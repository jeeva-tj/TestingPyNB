1,si0lu9,Persistent side effects 3 weeks post booster,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/si0lu9/persistent_side_effects_3_weeks_post_booster/,CovidVaccinated,"I got my moderna booster shot a little over 3 weeks ago. Woke up the next day with awful neck pain on the same side as the vaccination. The pain felt like a muscle strain but went all the way up into my ear.

A couple days later the neck pain went away but I was still left with some ear fullness/aching as well as jaw inflammation and pain. I could barely open my mouth it was so painful. Jaw pain persisted for about a week, went away I still have a little bit of tension there, and now I'm left with the feeling of ear fullness/pressure. Like I constantly need to pop my ears. They're crackling all the time with swallowing and moving my jaw. The ear on the side I got vaccinated is much worse than the other one. I have also notice a swollen lymph node on my neck (about pea sized) and one right in front of my ear, again same side as I was vaccinated. 
I had a virtual appointment with a doctor a week ago who prescribed antibiotics and a steroid nasal spray thinking it could be a sinus infection, but there has been no change. 
Thankfully I don't have any ringing in my ears, but this crackling and feeling of fullness is driving me nuts! I'm guessing it's an inflammatory response affecting my eustachian tubes, but it's taking so long to resolve that I'm getting worried. All the ear symptoms threads on here freak me out because they don't seem to be resolving for most people. I'm going to give it another week before making another doctor's appointment, but has any one else had similar symptoms that eventually ended up getting better? My first two shots I didn't have any kind of side effects like this at all, I'm really worried I permanently screwed my ears up by getting the booster shot.",2022-02-01,34,POST

I am not trying to cast doubt on pharmacists, just curious. Thanks for those able to weigh in.
EDIT: Solved. The vial could have been diluted wrong, but I could not have received diluent only. Further, only a few cases of incorrect dilution have been reported and I'm probably just lucky.",2022-02-01,5,POST

My question is, has anyone else experienced this? And if so what can I do to reduce the risks of a vasovagal syncope for my second shot? And were your symptoms bad in the second shot?

2. If #1 above is yes,  can a vaccinated person who contracts covid spread it to other people (are they contagious)?
3. Can a mask really prevent the spread of covid? Like a cloth mask?  I see conflicting reports on this, but it seems like as time goes on,  that you need a N95 rated mask.  I really have only seen a few people wearing this type of mask.

38,sfnye7,My Pfizer Booster Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/sfnye7/my_pfizer_booster_experience/,CovidVaccinated,"
Hello everyone. After spending days scrounging Reddit and twitter for other peoples experiences With the Pfizer booster I figured I would share mine. I have terrible health anxiety and was extremely reluctant to get a covid booster. If it were not for me changing jobs and my new employer requiring booster shots, I would not have gotten one. 
I was originally vaccinated on my own accord in June of 2021 with the J&J single dose. that shot put me through hell. Felt like dogshit for 48 hours. Chills, sweats, fever, you name it. the booster I received was the Pfizer jab. I am not the healthiest person. 6‚Äô3 250lbs. I try to eat well during the week but usually eat disgusting food and drink a lot on the weekends. Only exercise I get is a 2 mile walk with the dogs 3-4 times a week. 
Injection was at 1:15pm at my local Walgreens. Afterwards I went home and continued to work for the rest of the day. 
1 hour: nothing at all. Injection site doesn‚Äôt hurt. 
2 hours: nothing. Feel like I got really excited like 90 minutes ago and the excitement is wearing off. Kinda like a lite adrenaline rush. Probably anxiety. But it doesn‚Äôt hurt or anything. Arm has zero pain. 
3 hours: still nothing. My neck kinda hurts but I think I‚Äôm just hyper aware of it. Also have been hunched over staring at my computer for a while. So far so good 
4 hours: making dinner with the missus. Feel like my neck is stiff and upper back stiff as well. Could just be result of hunching over in my work chair all day and now hunching over the counter as I chop onions and garlic
5 hours: starting to feel bleh. More aware of my heartbeat (probably anxiety). Injection site feel like I banged into a door or something. Some upper body muscles starting to feel a little sore 
6 hours: injection arm is a little tender. Feel just about the same as an hour ago though. Maybe slightly colder but my house runs cold 
8 hours: staring to hit harder. Haze in my brain. Feeling kinda hot. Took two Tylenol because it feels like it‚Äôs ramping up. Going to cvs now to buy a thermometer. Luckily still feeling well enough to drive. Injection site still barely hurts and standing and walking are not challenging to do at the moment. Not down for the count just yet 
9 hours: alright cvs run went fine. Honestly when I‚Äôm just sitting and not doing anything I feel like the symptoms are worse. When I‚Äôm occupied with something by I feel fine. Very slight nausea. Now playing video games with the boys. Maybe a little headache? Drank a liquid IV. It‚Äôs really more anxiety that‚Äôs causing symptoms than anything else. 
10ish hours: went upstairs, going to try to get some sleep. This is the time I usually go to bed on a week night. Today is Friday so usually I‚Äôd stay up pretty late playing call of duty with the fellas, but figured id take it easy. I feel better than I did two hours ago which is promising. When I went up the stairs my legs felt heavy. They weren‚Äôt sore or anything just felt like they weighed a little extra. No headache. Still very slight nausea (probably anxiety). The arm I got the shot in feels heavy as well. Still not really sore. So far I‚Äôm surprised by my mild symptoms and I hope I don‚Äôt terrible chills or fever overnight. 
11ish hours: ended up staying up a little later watching tik toks with the missus. Don‚Äôt feel too bad still. 98.1 F temp. No
Never no chills. Arm is sore. Feel kind of hazy still in the head.  Let‚Äôs see how I sleep. 
15 hours: got a few hours of sleep. It came pretty easily. There were a few times I would be drifting asleep and then suddenly jolt awake, but I‚Äôm almost positive that was just me symptom-monitoring and feeling anxious. I don‚Äôt feel that bad. No fever no chills no nausea. I just feel ‚Äúicky‚Äù. I‚Äôve also noticed my heart feels like it‚Äôs beating harder, but not in a scary way. Heart rate is not elevated what so ever.  Usually I am a side sleeper but laying on my back tonight as my arm is quite tender at this point. Back to sleep now. 
17.5 hours: nearly morning now. Still no fever or chills at all. Limbs feel very heavy. Head feels full of bricks. Doesn‚Äôt really hurt, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to solve a bunch of math problems right now if that makes sense. I will probably take some Advil and get some more sleep. Injection arm feels like I got hit with a 90mph fastball in the deltoid. 
19 hours: getting out of bed finally to make some breakfast. I‚Äôve noticed so far I‚Äôve zero lymph node or armpit swelling like some people report. Limbs feeling heavy still but I should be able to get around and get things done today. 
22 hours: got a killer headache now. Will probably go back to bed soon. I‚Äôve seen some people experience a lot of symptoms after the 24hr mark and I hope that‚Äôs not me. 
24 hours: headache is gone after hydration and some rest. I wouldn‚Äôt say I feel back to normal now, but I feel like I could go out and do things today now. I do still feel bleh so I‚Äôll take it easy, but it‚Äôs definitely a manageable bleh. Severity of all of my symptoms seem to be descending. 
All in all a very nerve racking experience, but I am so grateful I didn‚Äôt have the same symptoms I had with J&J. Would I do it again? probably not, but just because I have some strong opinions about employers mandating covid vaccines (but I‚Äôll save that for another day üòâ)

My family, who I live with, wants me to get the Pfizer booster but personally, with how mild I've heard Omicron is for someone my age and healthy, I'm not sure if it's serious enough to justify the risks of side effects from the booster.

But now I‚Äôve been told I have to take a work related trip to three other countries in Europe and two of the countries require a booster to be fully vaccinated? My old vaccinations are expired in their eyes and one country does not allow proof of infection to extend vaccination card. 
I don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm 27yrs with no health issues, extremely healthy, vaccinated, and recovered from a recent covid infection.

The third full Moderna shot was the hardest. With all four shots I encountered a very sore arm and fatigue for the first few days after the shot. There were some issues of immune activation after the third shot (oral lichen planus exacerbation, for example) that  died down after a few days.
A week or two after the third shot I developed a day of diarrhea and about two weeks of mild but unpleasant gut issues. After that broke I was completely back to normal.
Now five months has passed since the third shot and Omicron is impacting our area in a way that no other variant has. Case numbers are staggering. And, at the same time, we are more open than at any other time in the Pandemic. Schools are open, the bars are full, people are partying with each other as if there was no pandemic killing well over 2,000 people a day!
So because there are so many unvaccinated selfish assholes around I had to go and get a fourth booster.
I get to the drive through area and there are so many workers standing around in only cloth masks! Isn‚Äôt  our health authority aware that they are practically useless against Omicron! I refuse their clipboard and pen. 
Also I had to sit at the vaccine station for 15 minutes while they ran around with their portable computer showing my data to everyone to figure out how to log a fourth shot! Finally they gave it to me, a half-dose of Moderna. That was around 11:30am.
By five pm my arm was sore and I could feel some fatigue. I slept well although my arm got more sore.
Yesterday (the day after my shot) I woke up at my normal hour and noticed I was fatigued and that my arm was still sore. We went on our usual two mile walk and I was dragging. The same for our one mile afternoon walk and 10 minute evening walk. 
I slept well again last night and woke up today at the usual time. I could tell I was still fatigued and my arm was still a bit sore but both issues were less in severity. No problem on the two mile walk. Appetite and meals the same as before the shot.
I also have the tiniest headache and don‚Äôt feel 100% but that is to be expected. 
My biggest fear is that I caught Omicron at the vaccine site. It will be a few days before I can put that fear to rest.
This is my last post in this group. There is no way to tell if any of the vaccine experiences here are legit (like mine) or are convincing but paid anti-vax boiler room posts. So I am out of here.

Theoretically my vaccine group was requested to get a booster now, 4 months after vaccination
But here are my concerns:
-4 months seems to be a bit away from the sweet spot period of 5-6 months to get a booster and have the best possible imuno response
-even after boosters, omicrom still seems to be easily spread among vaccinated people because of immune escape, this new virus spread fastly even in people that got covid previously, some studies suggest that people who got covid previously have near 0 protection to omicrom
-I'm 29M and work from home, not only I'm not a risk group and I don't offer a great risk for other people because I always use masks and rarely go outside but omicron also doesn't seem to be a threat as dangerous and urgent as delta or the first variant was
With that said, I've seem news about sinovac and pfizer planning to release a new vaccine focused on omicron in February or March, this makes me wonder if it's a better idea to wait until march until I get my booster even though my oficial date to get it was now of january

I went to my GP about it, and he listened to my heart beat and told me not to worry and to proceed with the second shot. The pain faded out a little, but it was still really bad at times. I got the second shot mid November. The pain started to get a lot worse after this. I once again visited my GP and he ordered a blood test and a breast ultrasound. The blood test said that my iron levels were borderline low, but nothing too bad. The breast ultrasound was also normal. The pain continued for another 2 months. I also experienced shortness of breath and occasional back pain. The pain spiked sometimes and got worse. Eventually, in January I once again visited my GP, and he took things more seriously this time. He ordered an ECG and a heart muscle blood test. I done the tests and the heart muscle test seemed mostly fine, but the ECG was abnormal. It showed a right bundle branch block/arrhythmia. The GP referred me to a cardiologist and my booking is next week.

-recovered from fever but the other two persisted, with chest pain being the new symptom
-the insomnia i was referring from the title is the one happened today (27th jan) + weird feelings, mind was racing which prevented me from falling asleep + hallucinations happened
snippet from the last part of my essay:
""which brings me to this subreddit, i was searching if people were experiencing the same thing and it turns out they did. from what i have found, it seems to be normal for people who have fever but they never said if they were experiencing insomnia/sleep disruption.

I would also like to hear from you all on how you deal with this, is this serious? Should I visit the hospital? Thank you so much for reading through this very long passage. I started typing this at around  7 am, and it is just a bit past 8 am now.""
For those who want to read the post normally, start here:
hi everyone, i am 20(m). i just got my booster shot this monday (24th January 2022). i already had sinovac as my first two doses and AZ as my booster. i would like to share what i experienced and what i am still experiencing now as of writing this post. (27th January 2022) the reason why i am doing this is i am scared and i have anxiety. this is going to be long one, i am sorry for taking up your time and thank you for those for stayed till the end.
i did not experience any side effects for the first two doses but AZ however was and is still a sufferable one. to give a small background info, i had not gotten a fever since January 2020 until this Monday.
this was the day i got vaccinated, when the needle was removed from my arm, my right leg immediately experienced pain and soreness for some reason. in the evening, the side effect expected kicked in with it being fever. i went to bed at around 11 pm, and i was able to sleep well until i suddenly woke up at 1 am, i did not get up however. during this period, i was experiencing headaches and pain from some parts of my body, cycling namely from my arms, my legs, my shoulders, the sides of my throat and my abdomen (mostly at the lower right). 
after that, i tried to get up and went to the bathroom because i was wanting to urine for quite some time now. as soon as i get up, my vision went yellow for a split second and my head immediately felt like it was empty and light. it was as if i was dizzy, walking towards the toilet, using them and going back to my bed, while feeling like i didn't have any balance and was going to fall.
after getting back to bed, i started to feel normal again but headaches, pain around my body and fever still persisted. during that period, i was actually reluctant to take in panadol (paracetamol, and i used the soluble one) until i couldn't take it anymore. at 4 am, i took one dose of panadol, it was 500g of paracetamol and went back to bed. while the panadol didn't really alleviate any of those pain and aches, i was finally able to sleep and I woke up at around 9am.
 this was now the 25th. as soon as i woke up, i felt normal aside feeling feverish, but immediately after standing up, i felt a bit light headed as i went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and to take a dump. after a few minutes when i closed the door, i started to feel like i was deprived of oxygen. i immediately ran out and lied down on a bed and the feeling disappeared. this was also the time where i started to notice my heart rate was higher than usual (i didnt exactly measure it but it was definitely >80 bpm for resting).
throughout the day, i still had the same symptoms, but they weren't as severe as I took a tablet every 4 hours (so, 4 total tablets for 25th). though i still had high heart rate, i didnt lose my appetite so that was relieving. in the afternoon, i tried to take a nap after taking panadol but to no avail. however, a new symptom kicked in, which was chest pain. my chest was radiating a pain that made me panicked more than ever, but it only lasted for a few minutes and it never happened again as of writing this post. 
when evening came, i started to feel much better, and after consuming my last panadol tablet of the day after my dinner, my body temperature went back down to 37¬∞C and i was able to sleep soundly for 8 hours. 
it is now 26th January which was yesterday. i had recovered from my fever which made me in a good mood though i still had slight headaches every now and then (not constantly having them). Weirdly enough, only now my arm started to hurt more than the previous days. i stopped taking panadol. nothing much happened during the day and the evening and everything went normal as usual before i got the booster.
after a little youtube videos watching before i put down my phone at 1 am (yes this was about 6 hours ago which means it is now today, 27th January), i realised that I wasn't able to sleep. no matter how hard i tried, what positions I tried to lie down on, i just wasn't able to fall asleep. i also realised my heart rate wasn't at 60 bpm for resting as it should be, and my mind kept thinking stuff that kept me awake. in addition, my muscles were twitching all over the place. first was the arm that was injected, then the other arm and my legs. not only that, the times that i did manage to fall asleep every so slightly, i was either ""shocked"" by my brain and woke up suddenly or i felt like my body was burning which forced me to open my eyes and wake up. this made me even more unable to sleep, flipping and turning on my bed until 4 am. 
i played calming nature music to try and make me sleep easier. while it did somewhat help as i was able to fall asleep for about 20 minutes, i unfortunately woke up again. however, when i tried to sleep back once again, i hallucinated(?) for the first time upon closing my eye. from what i remember, i was able to see light, hear the voices of my mom and my brother saying it was 25th December, and i was able to feel my leg being pulled as if they were waking me up. i immediately woke up after that but there was no one there, it's still dark everywhere and i felt a burning sensation on my legs. i tried to close my eyes again, and it happened again, this time it was my whole body that felt like it was burning. 
the third time didn't happen as i closed my eye but I wasn't able to sleep either. i continue to stay awake but my eyes were closed until 5.30 am which was when my parents woke up. my mom came in at around 6 am and i told her i couldn't sleep and she comforted me before leaving my room and continuing with her daily routine. 
i tried to sleep again but this time i had a different hallucination. this time, the image i was hallucinating was green in colour, sorta like the reflected image you sometimes see from your glasses. this time, the setting was a living room, and the hallucination did not appear immediately but it slowly formed behind nothingness. (all the hallucinations happened while my eyes were close but I wasn't exactly sleeping, or that is what i felt). again, i immediately woke up as a result and the second time, which was the last time, happened. after all of that, it was already 6.30 am so i had decided to wake up. honestly, it just feels like any other day, i don't feel that tired but I'm sure the fatigue will start to kick in as the day progresses. i did a bit of searching online because you know, anxiety, and of course it scared me.
which brings me to this subreddit, i was searching if people were experiencing the same thing and it turns out they did. from what i have found, it seems to be normal for people who have fever but they never said if they were experiencing insomnia/sleep disruption. 
If anyone who is experiencing/experienced the same problem, please do describe your story, I would like to hear them. I would also like to hear from you all on how you deal with this, is this serious? Should I visit the hospital? Thank you so much for reading through this very long passage. I started typing this at around  7 am, and it is just a bit past 8 am now.

Because of lockdowns, long, deep night reading twitter's stupidest conspiracy theories, but still got scared because I could not stop me from looking for more. 
The new thing here in my country is an alleged increase in heart failure, heart attack. It (seems) that more and more people are dying from heart related illness or just sudden death still related to their heart, especially in young people, including athletes. 
My question is, did that always happened, even before vaccination ? I guess it sure has, but is there really an increase ? Or is it just more diffused by the medias because of the situation ? It worries me a little. The idea of a sudden thing like that.

No booster was available when we started traveling nor was it available in Spain for our age group during our stay.
About 2-1/2 Weeks ago we suffered from a Covid infection with high fever and medium symptoms, Spanish hospital did not run a PCR type test though. We both tested positive and got symptoms and isolated in hotel for more than a week. Self tests stopped being positive after about 8-9 days.
Having recovered now and being on our way back through France, I was denied access to restaurants yesterday because my Vaccination is 7 Months old now (hers is a bit newer and still accepted).
I do not want to suffer restrictions in everyday life because I am not boosters - but I am not sure if it makes any sense to get vaccinated again just days after recovering from a Covid infection (and being fully vaccinated in the first place).
Also, the second shot Moderna gave me 4 days of fever with up to 40 degrees Celsius temperature. The infection ""just"" gave me 39 degrees Celsius fever. I am afraid my immune system will go crazy if I get a booster now.

Ironic isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶
He said this:
Hello!  you have heart pain because the covid vaccine causes heart problems, sometimes even myocarditis.  The spike proteins the covid vaccine makes your body produce eat away at your heart tissue and other organs which can become very uncomfortable.  You will probably be fine as long as you don't take any further covid vaccines, but you will have permanent heart tissue scarring which never goes away.

I received the Moderna booster on Thursday, January 20 at 3pm.  My first 2 were Pfizer last year (typical mild symptoms: painful arm, body aches, headache).
I (36F) contracted genital herpes HSV in 2009 and my outbreaks have been progressively less often.  My last outbreak was I think 2018 or 2019.  
On Friday, Jan 21 I felt like crap: body aches, chills, terrible headache, low back/hip joint pain especially.  I started having excessive discharge (a typical outbreak symptom, for me) and outbreak sores not even 24 hours after the booster.  I was surprised since I haven‚Äôt had an outbreak in quite a while.  I was able to get a prescription for Valtrex.  I honestly didn‚Äôt tell the Dr. I got the booster the day before because I know the prescription will help reduce the outbreak to about 5 days instead of 15ish.
I also have a large square shaped pain in my center chest when inhaling.  I can only breath in about 30% until I start to feel pain.  I feel it from my throat to the bottom of my sternum.  I feel it less today, Sunday, than I did yesterday, Saturday.  I don‚Äôt want to go to urgent care/ER since the hospitals are full of COVID patients here.  I live in Spain (American though) so it wouldn‚Äôt cost me anything except my own time and possibly contracting COVID there.  Since I feel it less today than yesterday, I will keep an eye out for it. 
I will submit the HSV and chest pain symptoms to the government COVID vaccine symptom tracker though.",2022-01-23,6,POST

 I got my booster on 12/20. 30 min after the booster my mouth got all tingly and my heart started racing. I thought I was having an allergic reaction so I went home and took Benadryl and didn‚Äôt think much of it. The next day, I woke up with a low grade fever, body aches, headache, and an elevated heart rate. It was going as high as 145. I went to my Dr who sent me to the ER and my ekg, chest X-ray, and blood tests were normal. They said it was just an adverse reaction and it would go away. My heart rate improved for about a week and a half. Then I woke up one morning with chills (no fever), joint pain, flu-like feeling. I got tested for covid, which was negative. This progressed to abdominal pain which eventually got so bad I went back to the ER and the CT showed colitis. Two days later I woke up in the middle of the night with insane muscle spasms in my legs-my legs were flailing around along with numbness and tingling in my arms and legs. I went back to the ER- inflammation labs and head CT all normal. The horrible spasms have subsided, but I have small muscle twitches every once in a while. I went back to the dr and requested another ekg (4 weeks after vaccine) and it showed a ‚Äúpossible right bundle branch block.‚Äù I‚Äôm freaking out. 
My most annoying symptoms would be the continuing palpitations, chest pain, fatigue, and brain fog. I‚Äôve also had moments of waking up out of a dead sleep gasping for air with a racing heart, which is terrifying. I‚Äôm going to have to be out of work for the time being it‚Äôs so bad. Im terrified to drive because I feel like I‚Äôm not even in my body. I can‚Äôt take care of my son or my house. If I get off the couch, my heart rate is 120. I‚Äôm getting and echo and a holter monitor for 48hr. I think I have POTS, but I can‚Äôt get into the cardiologist until April 1st. 
Any hope with recovery? I can‚Äôt be out of work for an endless amount of time. This is already taking a huge toll on me. Of course I was prescribed Xanax and Zoloft. Neither of which decrease my symptoms because it‚Äôs not anxiety. At least the Xanax helps me sleep.",2022-01-23,112,POST

I have yet to contract it, which I credit to the vaccine. I am glad to be vaccinated, but have had some irritating side effects after shots 2 and 3. 
Curious‚Äì anyone experience anything like the below? Recap of my symptoms: 
Shot 1 (early March 2021): No side effects except for a sore arm
Shot 2 (late march 2021):  tension headache and brain fog on-and-off for 2 months. When experiencing brain fog, there was usually some visual field disorientation. Not quite tunnel vision, but felt like things in my periphery were harder to process, and in general I felt mentally a beat behind. 
Shot 3 (Mid december): Initially, only sore lymph nodes. However, a month after the shot, out of seemingly nowhere the tension headache and brain fog returned, with vision issues. This has lasted about a week now, and has been more consistent than before, but a bit more mild‚Äì however still frustrating and debilitating. I am having trouble focusing and this is also preventing me from Cycling (my passion), as I feel it's risky when feeling mentally clouded. 
I saw a GP and a neurologist after shot 2‚Äì both said it's too early, we know nothing except these vaccines cause a lot of inflammation. Wait it out. 
I saw an eye doctor yesterday for a yearly appointment and discussed with him. He told me it could be ""vertical heterophobia"" caused by inflammation‚Äì potentially treatable with lenses, but I should wait to see if it fades before treating (as obviously this would change both glasses and contact prescriptions, and may not be needed permanently).",2022-01-21,10,POST

I got vaccinated with BionTech Pfizer on May 5th 2021, June 8th 2021 and Jan 17th 2022.
One day after the second vaccination I started recognising small dots/flashes of light happening in my vision. Mostly they were very small, like a fly, and stayed there for half a second.
It was like: one flash, ‚Ä¶ 10 min no flash, one flash, ‚Ä¶ 1 min no flash, ‚Ä¶
in this way it happended unregularly throughout the day. Have been to hosptial because I also got heavy Diarrhoe for 3 weeks and an intermitting droopy left eyelid (intermitting ptosis throughout the day, every myasthenia gravis test was negative).
Did many vision tests, brain MRT, blood tests, brain CT, ‚Ä¶ exactly nothing was found.
Docs just ignored my suspicion that it‚Äòs from the vaccine because it‚Äòs safe and it causes no symptoms like this.
After two months or so it disappeared slowly.
I got the third vacc now on Jan 17th 2022. And gues what: One day after the vacc my flashes and dots came back and so did my droopy eyelid.

Why:
I think it would help everyone that currently has it have a sense of the average time to expect to have it, if not permament.

My Tinnitus:
Started Nov. 24th. 3 Months after my Moderna vaccine. I'm suspicious as to maybe I contracted COVID and was asymptomatic. (Similar to Jorge Ramos). I noticed ringing on my left ear at 11PM. (Just recently I notice I also hear a hum/quiet rumble of a car in parked type of sound on my right ear, but it's very faint and I suspect it's been there since I got the ringing (Really need to focus on it to hear it) 1st night I got it, I was only able to sleep 3 hours.

If people don't want to be vaccinated they should allowed to, as long as they agree to wear a mask everywhere and submit to regular covid testing.

Got sent in for blood work, specifically to check the values on my prostate. Results were also fine. My gp referred me for an ultrasound of my complete lower abdomen, but this also returned nothing abnormal. Symptoms got slightly better over the following months.
This was until I received my Pfizer booster the 21st of December. Symptoms got worse again and this was the first time I even considered these symptoms to be a side effect of my vaccination.
I got prescribed Vesicare (solifenacin) to reduce bladder pressure. Currently in my third week and I finally see a bit of improvement.

This was before I was eligible to get a vaccine. I had a fever for 7 days and then turned info pneumonia. Finally on day 9 the doctor called in a steroid, medication, and an inhaler to the pharmacy. I had a chest xray day 10 to show the pneumonia. The chest cleared up after the steroid and medication was done. A month later in March I woke up one Sunday with a slightly swollen inner right leg calf. They sent me for an ultrasound for DVT and that came back negative. After that I got blood work done and all my inflammation markers were super high. This is already early April 2021 in which I had pretty bad knee pain so I saw Orthopedic who prescribed an anti inflammatory medication and physical therapy. Once I started all that the calf swelled went away and I got stronger in the legs. I went months feeling normal besides knee issues in which everyone said because my inflammation was high that could be why. I decided to get Pfizer middle of June and a week later my right knee started to swell. I got the 2nd dose early July and since then I've had slight swelling in right knee up into thigh. I started seeing a lymphatic therapist for massages and compression stockings. I went to Boston for a Lymphoscintigraphy test, but that came back negative. Since it was negative that doctor said to stop wearing compression to see what happens. A few days later my feet and ankles were swelling depending on what I did or if I was on my feet for long. Eventually everything else was fine. My lymphatic therapist said whatever is going on seems as a sluggish lymphatic system. With all this I contacted the doctor in Boston and now I am schedules for another lymphatic test, but more sensitive. At this time my knee and thigh is still swelling. I have what kinda feels like a tight or pulling sensation in my inner thigh. Recently I'm starting to see more veins. I've been reading about covid being a circulation/vascular condition. Makes me wonder if covid brought out lymphatic issues/lymphedema for being sick as long as I was even though everyone doesn't understand what's going on. I've heard from other lymphatic therapists and doctors dealing with lymphedema patients that they have seen an uptick in people coming to clinics with swelling issues after either being sick or the vaccine.

206,s5vjfb,What if you get the vaccine or booster not knowing(asymptomatic phase) you have an active infection simultaneously? (This question doesn't really apply to healthy vaccinated or naturally immunized folks from previous Covid who can just ride it out with mild symptoms.),https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/s5vjfb/what_if_you_get_the_vaccine_or_booster_not/,CovidVaccinated,"This is the question No Doctor is Talking About though they probably know the answer.  So Omicron is spreading like wildfire and many people who had their vaccines more than 6 months ago are thinking, better get the booster and when they do, they don't know that they currently have Covid Omicron from the person close by who sneezed or coughed and the symptoms hadn't showed up on the day of your shot. The vaccine spikes are just supposed to be a practice run to make antibodies and fight the virus when you haven't got the actual virus already rapidly replicating at super speed inside your body.  Basically its a double whammy of spike proteins, from the virus and the vaccine.
How important is it to avoid this? Is it like getting hit with paint balls and real bullets at the same time?Will this make you sicker if you had the vaccine, say  less than 2 weeks before catching Covid and your body had no time to prepare - especially if you have serious underlying conditions like breathing difficulty or obesity?
I was all set to get a booster and got coughed at by a store employee with a really bad chest congestion and had to take some drastic steps to disinfect myself. Short staffed medical facilities and businesses are making people without symptoms, or mildly sick, but knowingly positive, go to work or lose pay and spread this very infectious variant to everyone.   I feel like once I get boostered, I need to be locked down until the vaccine had done what its supposed to before taking my chances with the real virus. My previous one shot J&J resulted in no antibodies against the spike when it should have been at its strongest based on the IgG and IgM Spike lab test (I had a bad feeling when I had zero side effects) and my doc said I have no neutralizing effect from that vaccine so get a booster ASAP - meanwhile local testing sites have closed due to staff shortage or takes a week or longer for results and home tests are sold out.
I keep getting the feeling that most people on Reddit tend to be basically healthy (Omicron is just a day of sore throat and sniffles)  and the really sick ones are not online except for the unfortunate ones who were healthy and somehow ended up with long covid or unexpected vaccine side effects and their life took a sudden nose dive to the ranks of the chronically ill.
I've got underlying conditions like low oxygen dropping to 70% from sleep apnea even with supplemental oxygen concentrator and BIPAP and daytime only about 94% with a leaky heart valve and obesity...so honestly what is mild for most people may not be for me.  If I didn't have racing heart rate of 100 beats per minute waking me up multiple times at night, I would have gotten a mRNA booster already so this question of getting virus and vaccine is worrying me.",2022-01-17,8,POST

This may be true, however from my perspective we have a variant which is mild however growing at a crazy rate and our hospitalisation and death ratio is growing day by day. I simply do not want to get covid, and if I do I‚Äôd rather be getting it because of something I hadddd to do. For example going out to buy groceries. I just cannot justify going out to parties or meeting friends when there are people dying because of a virus around me. I would also feel responsible if I had the virus and am asymptomatic but I spread it to others, potentially killing them as a worst case scenario. Would I ever be able to live with that though? Hell no. It is also not helping our medical professionals who are risking their lives to treat patients with limited equipments. So I will be taking precautions like staying indoors as much as I can, wearing the recommended P2 N95 masks when possible and using hand sanitisers.

I had my Pfizer booster on December 21st. I wish I had never agreed to it. 
Immediately post-Vax I got a rushing sensation like adrenaline which eventually gave way to chest tightness and some shortness of breath over the next few days. I've been to the gym a few times since and it's been horrible each time. I tried to play tennis with my Dad 8 days post-Vax and we had to stop about 40 minutes in because I felt really weak and a fluttering sensation in my chest / abdomen. 
It is now nearly a month post and I feel practically no better. Yesterday I visited a private cardiologist in London who has scheduled an Echocardiogram, ECG and 7-day ECG monitor as well. He said in his practice they are seeing this 'more and more'. 
I am struggling to find any mention of these longer-term sides ANYWHERE online except Reddit. Mainstream UK news outlets (BBC, Daily Mail, Evening Standard, The Express) have absolutely no mention of side effects beyond the very basic ones (pain at the injection site etc).

I have a real strong response to the booster (and the other doses) that lasted 4 days and during that time started also developing Covid symptoms, tested positive 6 days after.

Started with muscle aches that got so bad I couldn‚Äôt really get out of bed even if I wanted to. 
Taste and smell were lost, I also still have no real signal or whatever to eat. I have to just do it, I never feel like I wanna or need to eat now.
Then I got really really congested (and still am as I write this) and coughing started from that.
And on top of all that kept vomiting for a day. 
I was fatigued the whole time but a week into it I felt completely wrong and tired all over like I‚Äôve never felt before, that day I developed abnormal heart rates and hypoxemia. Ended up having to go to the ER and was so out of it when I got there I hardly remember it until I woke up the next day

I never ended up on a ventilator or anything crazy except the oxygen and meds so maybe the vaccine helped with that.

Sorry to drop a post but I‚Äôve got a question for you all. I am an NHS worker who was forced to get vaccinated otherwise I risk loosing my job. So I got vaccinated. I am not an anti vaxxer at all. 
But after getting my vaccine I had a mild headache which was bearable. However on my second day 24 hours after getting my vaccine I started feeling tingling in my hands. Thinking nothing of it I ignored it. Throughout the day the tingling progressed through my arms down to my thighs and into my calf‚Äôs ending in my feet. It continued to tingle in these regions for 5 days. 
I honestly thought it was a skin reaction to new washing powder in the washing machine because all my clothes on my skin felt sensitive. 
Now, when I wake up in the morning my feet are tingling and pulsating. I did speak to my doctor on day three and he told me to wait until they seven and then ring back but he put it down to anxiety. Just to be clear I am not anxious. 
Is anybody else experiencing this and could they advise me what to do please because I am starting to feel scared about it and I‚Äôm trying to resist googling things.",2022-01-15,7,POST

Anyway.  Wednesday after leaving lunch with some coworkers I felt really drained. I‚Äôm working out of town so when I got to the hotel I passed out but woke up multiple times throughout the night sweating, screaming, hallucinating (nothing bad like a double take would fix the issue) I was so thirsty but I didn‚Äôt have anything to drink and I refuse to drink tap water from a hole in the wall hotel. 
No thermometer or any medicines so guess is the hallucinations came from fever. 
I slept the night, called out of work, slept the day, forced myself to get up around 730pm and buy some fruit and get some waters. 
Felt a lot better after this but still like complete garbage if that makes any sense. 
I feel confused a lot and forget half of what I‚Äôve said to people. 
Today is Friday, Went to the doctors today. Positive result from rapid. 
I‚Äôve continued to eat grapes, apples, eggs plain, tuna plain, nuts, and chugging essentia water though I must say I think body armour is better. 
My chest is tight, I‚Äôm coughing more and more, I feel like I could eat 5 meals but am not getting full.

so in australia they have said you can take a booster at 4 months but at the end of jan they are changing it to 3 months..
one of our states have mandated 2 vax + 1 booster for some workers to now keep their job..
Just a curious questions for those who didn‚Äôt really want the vaccine and got the initial 2 to keep working..
what would be your cut off?
i just know so many people that were hesitant but got the initial 2 as they thought that would be it and they can continue as normal after that. 
let‚Äôs say if they mandate boosters for your job every 3-4 months for the next couple years 
Would you continue? 
I myself found another job to get out of the cycle and i feel sooo relieved that i can make my own decision moving forward

At 3am, out of nowhere on day 6 I experience the worst GI pain I've ever had, my entire torso and back are in pain and feel like gas is building without any type of release. I vomit multiple times and have sharp stomach pains all night into the day. We are now at day 7, I got into urgent care at this point and they send me to ER. ER runs all kinds of tests for my stomach/bloodwork and everything comes back normal. I ask if it's possible my booster did this and they say it's not impossible that it would inflame my stomach but can't confirm. They gave me some meds for my nausea and acid and send me home.

262,s2hlc8,Myocarditis Awareness,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/s2hlc8/myocarditis_awareness/,CovidVaccinated,"Hi all, I'm sharing this in the hopes of gaining some insight and support as well as raising some awareness.
As a disclaimer I want to say that I am not antivax; I've had both vaccine shots (Pfizer) and my Pfizer Booster (30.12.2021).
I had my booster two weeks ago. Initially the usual symptoms (fever, flu, tiredness) but after the first 2 days I suddenly had trouble breathing, shortness of breath, body pain, fatigue and brain fog. I spoke to my GP who sent me to hospital where all my vitals were fine. Ecg, bloods, xray, CT scan... nothing showed up. I was told to go home and rest which I did do. 
After another few days nothing was improving, I couldn't work, I was struggling to raise my arms above my head, bathe myself or focus on anything. It was only when I came to this SubReddit that I discovered other people having similar symptoms to me. 
For some context, I'm a mid thirties guy who gyms 4/5 days a week. Eats well, active social life and I love my work. I'm a front line worker which has given me a lot of job satisfaction during the pandemic. My whole life changed overnight and it was terrifying.
I started taking Ibuprofen as someone suggested on one of their posts because I didn't know what else to do and my breathing began to improve almost immediately. I also started taking Magnesium supplements which has massively helped with body pains. I believe there are other supplements / medications that can help but I'm not overly familiar with them yet. 
I spoke with another GP today and when I explained my symptoms he said: I want to check you out for Myocarditis. Which was such a relief in some ways, that he was aware of the condition and aware of the possible link (however tenuous) to the booster shot. It's so tough being sick when no one believes you're sick. I was told by many people that I was just stressed and needed to sleep, which I have been doing loads of, but hearing that my concerns were validated after being missed by so many doctors gave me a massive sense of relief that I wasn't going crazy. 
I'm sharing this as I didn't have this information when it happened to me and the whole experience has been very scary. When I've looked into Myocarditis and the treatments it makes me very hopeful that I can get back to normal life with the right treatment. 
Please Google Myocarditis and read some of the new articles surfacing about the risk group, it is mostly effecting males between the ages of 16 and 50. Although the age range does change depending on the source. 
Also if anyone is experiencing any of these symptoms please do reach out. It's not going to get better if you 'just rest', and recovery is absolutely possible with the right treatment. 
I'm not tying to put anyone off the vaccine, vaccines save lives and they have done massive amounts of good during this pandemic. However, if you start to experience symptoms do have a look at the articles and speak to your health provider about support. 
I'd be interested in hearing from anyone else experiencing something similar, what your treatment is, how you're coping and how you're staying sane! My Netflix is almost depleted.

So after my second Pfizer shot, i began having tingling legs, like a constant buzzing feeling. And weird cold/hot feeling on both thighs. Now its been 5 months since my shot and i still have it, some periods are better than others, but it is still constant.
I am signed up for the booster shot this friday, but i am honestly freaking out.
I do not want to make it worse, or prolong what i already have.
Before my vaccine i never experienced tingling in my legs, and it would be a real coincidence if it were related to other things, since it started the same day as my second shot.
I asked my doc about it 2 weeks after my shot, and he said it would probably go away soon, but clearly hasnt.
I am not really looking forward to going in there again, because it Seems that no one dealing with the same nerve issues have found any help or cure.

Throwaway for personal reasons.
My friend really needs help, wondering if anyone knows any good GPs or specialists or has had a similar experience in Melbourne Australia?
Hello CVDU
I am in some quite urgent need of help for a friend (male 20-30yo) who has had a quite serious adverse reaction to the Pfizer reaction in August 2021. He was misdiagnosed and pericarditis was missed on many ECGs (all agreed it was from the vaccine) in some hospitals interstate where he was located for work and had to eventually return to Melbourne.
My friend is talking with some doctors here who will not still refer him to a cardiologist. They tell him they don't know how long this will affect him for. Pericarditis medication has not worked with his symptoms. They are telling him he has had an allergic reaction to the spike protein which is causing auto immune symptoms (nerve pain, pressure in head, low energy, dizziness, nausea) but won't refer him to a rheumatologist. The only specialist this doctor had referred him to is an immunologist who just wants to talk about the second dose. Every week they have an appointment and the doctor asks how he is and he is always terrible and had not improved for months, yet they don‚Äôt seem to want to get to the bottom of this.
He has only persisted with these doctors as they have been willing to help him with the adverse reaction scheme, but are now saying they refuse to sign off on his claim for 12 months of disability/loss of income, even though they repeatedly (appointments every week) tell him they don't know how to diagnose him or help him and are not sure how long he will be like this? They also have told him not to return to work?
He is completely bed ridden, there has been no diagnosis still - 6 months after the fact and all they want to do is book him in for his second dose and now won't sign off on his claim. This has clearly given him even more anxiety. He has no money and can't care or provide for himself. He has stated he will get the second dose, he just wants to feel better now or someone to take his symptoms seriously.
Has anyone had any luck with any doctors or GPs or specialists that could maybe help him in Melbourne? No one seems to want to get to the bottom of this and help my friend feel better. They now, after being quite helpful with the claim, are refusing to sign off on his claim (which has been written by a lawyer so is very by the book).
I feel this has been terribly managed by them. He has never even been referred to a cardiologist or had a cardiac MRI or anything for his apparent pericarditis. We just want help for our friend as it's pretty scary watching his decline/loss of function everyday.
Please, can anyone help or does anyone have any advice. Sorry for the word vomit.",2022-01-12,4,POST

I don't scare easily but this I am afraid of and i will tell you why. 
I got my first dose of Pfizer just before Christmas and had the usual side effects they said i would have within the first couple days but then afterwards i felt very unwell for a period of 5 more days and then on the 6th day post injection i became severely ill with full flegded Covid/Flu like symptoms. The 6th and 7th day were an absolute nightmare. I had not been this ill in nearly 20 years since i was a child with the Flu. 
My symptoms were: Fever 103¬∞ (lasted 10 days),  Intense painful coughing with yellow phlegm in lungs, severe chills and shaking that could only be relieved by a hot shower, profuse sweating, congestion, several patches of white sores in the back of my throat with severe pain, body & joint aching, headaches, and shortness of breath. I did not make a full recovery until 12 days later. 
I was tested with a PCR nasal swab for Covid-19 at the peak of my illness just 7 days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine and results came back positive for Covid-19. I have researched across the spectrum of the internet to this day i do not know whether this was directly caused by Covid or by the vaccine. What i found were public medical documents of cases that were reported on which some patients had tested positive for Covid-19 after their initial dose of the vaccine as well as others who recieved the vaccine did not. Some developed Covid-19 after becoming initially vaccinated known as breakthrough cases. Other websites i scoured had said definitively that an mRNA vaccine can not allow you to test positive on PCR nasal test as the mRNA vaccines have no live or watered down virus within them. 
Some have told me it was mere coincidence that i caught Covid-19 at the same time i received my initial vaccination and others are skeptical saying it was surely a reaction from the vaccine. I will likely never know or will i soon come my 2nd dose? 
I did not go to the hospital and i tried everything i could to stay out because my health insurance had just expired and i will not have insurance until i begin work with my employer who is mandating the vaccine hence which is the reason i received the initial dose. Now however i am afraid of experiencing what i went through the first time again in the coming days ahead and possibly even worse. 
I have scheduled to receive Moderna as my 2nd dose. Given my experience i thought receiving a different brand would be better as i seemingly had severe adverse reactions after the initial Pfizer shot.
I've done as much research as i possibly could on various government and health websites and what i have found is that it appears to be unsafe at this time to mix primary doses of different brands as there is just not enough data currently on the subject. The CDC also does not recommend mixing primary doses. Based on my story and experience what should i do? Do i get a different brand of the 2nd dose or do i continue with Pfizer?  
All of my life i have been fully vaccinated since i was a child and i have never experienced anything more than just typical arm soreness but this was the worst thing i had ever experienced and i am truely afraid of what another dose will do to me. 
I am in a troubling predicament as i have no choice to opt out. I absolutely need this job or I will have nowhere to live and also have no health insurance. I don't know how my body will react to another dose and if it safe.",2022-01-12,9,POST

I was just looking for some feed back or opinions!
I received my first vaccine of moderna on November 20th, I had a pretty severe reaction which spooked me a bit. I was told to wait 3 weeks until I could get the second dose. I ended up getting a virus bug and was sick (tested for covid and was negative) a couple days before my apt for my second. I decided to cancel the apt and recover first. Then life happens the holidays came and went and here we are I‚Äôm getting married this Thursday! 
It‚Äôs in state only a 2 hour car drive, no flying guests, over half are vaccinated, and it‚Äôs small (35 including me and my fianc√©). I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if I should be good to wait til after the wedding for my vaccine I just don‚Äôt want to be in pain during my wedding or have any of the side affects. Anyways just looking for some feed back. Do I have some immunity with being young and healthy and having the first dose? I hope everyone is staying safe!

Woke up with massive calf muscle pajn/tightness after 6 days,
In ER twice, and docs don't know why I am in pain.
it's a side effect from the vaccine.
3 weeks from first symptoms and my leg is still stiff and the tingling hasn't stopped either. Plus random stabbing pain around the abdomen and dull pain around the pectoralis major.
They ruled out blood clot based on blood tests or heart issues from an ECG.
They suspect myalgia but won't exempt me for my second shot?!
Any drug someonw takes in general that causes myalgia docs recommend it to be discontinued right away. 
I am very concerned. Based on clinical studies, there symptoms worsen with 2nd shot.
Update 1
 doc is going to send me to get more blood work to see if myalgia can be confirmed from it. But that to say, I'm very discouraged as the first thing the doc says and focuses on is to tell me:""it's nothing, you just have anxiety"". Insane, they are dismissing real pain I'm experiencing. :/
Update 2
Doc said I might have blood clot after all
He wants me to redo the tests and if levels are high he's sending me to hospital.
Update 3
All additional blood test results came out negative. Those include:
CRP
FIBRIN D-DIMER
Creatinine/GFR
Creatine Kinase
Rheumatoid Factor
I still experience ongoing pain in the calf and random stabbing pain around the abdomen area. Will update after follow up with doc again who can hopefully help get to the bottom of this.
Update 4
ER doctor ordered a spinal MRI for me to see if I have nerve damage or herniated disc and put me on Celebrex.
Update 5
MRI reading shows mild multilayer L3-L5 degenerative changes with mild spinal canal narrowing and facet arthropathy in L4-S1. The doc says it's not significant and put me on Tylenol with codeine.

I also got my flu shot which is only second time in my life getting one . Got one last year due to covid so I wouldn't likely get the flu while covid was spreading...
Sorry for the rambling I only got 2 hours of sleep after taking a sleeping aid plus had two cups of coffee which I don't normally have caffeine so I'm a bit loopy atm.
Reason I didn't get tested was I dont have a proper means of transportation other then friends and family ATM even tho they are vaccinated with some getting the booster this past week didn't wanna risk it even if I was just asystematic with cold type symptoms (which from my understanding is kind of common with current verient- hope that's not wrong information - don't want to be part of the false information spreading)

They checked vitals again, all good. Confirmed my xray was clear. Sent me to outpatients. Outpatients did all my tests again... still clear.
Then they think I have blood clots in the blood vessels in my lungs (?) so inject me with Warfarin and tell me to come back next day for a CT scan. The whole time I'm telling them I'm having a reaction to the booster and they're saying that's not possible.
CT scan is clear, no blood clots. Yay. So they send me home with antihistamines and tell me to rest for 2 weeks cos I've had some sort of reaction to the booster!
I've had maybe 10 days of breathlessness. I can't work, I can't gym, I struggle to walk. I can't keep doing this. I feel like I've aged 20 years over night. I'm at the end of my fucking rope. Has anyone else had this before?

My dad, who is high-risk, was just in the hospital for a month.  He is now home and recovering and only wants people who have had their booster shot to visit him.  I have avoided the booster because I am 30 years old (men under 30 are at increased risk of heart problems from the booster) and because my second Moderna dose was very intense.  I will admit to being anxious about the vaccines, but my second dose came with a lot of uncomfortable and slightly concerning side effects, some of which lasted for weeks.
So my question is: Will me getting the booster have any impact on my dad's health?  Meaning, will getting the booster prevent me from spreading Covid to others, and, if it doesn't prevent spread, will doing so reduce the severity of symptoms of others who might get Covid from me?

I have seen 3 in the hospital related to the covid booster ( 1 with MS, 1 with lupus, and 1 82 year old). But not to be outdone, I've seen countless unvaccinated for covid. Why can't the side effects of vaccination be acknowledged in guidelines like they were for johnson and johnson right before it got the silent boot. This booster is unnecessary for many, not all. You will get covid but you will have the baseline protection to prevent severe illness. In a perfect world everyone will get the initial vaccine dose (yes it is not as safe as it should be but covid does discriminate and those without any prior exposure / vaccination are those that have issues when exposed), but also in a perfect world these vaccines would be safer and I don't think I'm acknowledging any politics in saying so.

NOTE: I am pro-vaccine but I am being held back from taking the covid-19 vaccines because of my parents (who are one of the reasons why I want to take it in the first place).
Hi, I'm a teenager who has been raised in an environment with parents against vaccinations for a large portion of my life, and I'm sick of dealing with both the pressures from my parents to not and the social pressures of possibly endangering others (and I also don't want to put my unvaccinated parent with anaemia at any more risk than they're already at), therefore making me want to just get the vaccine now. There is nobody to talk to really in my daily life therefore I am asking this on the internet if that is alright. My parents monitor me very much for the average teen making it near to impossible to get vaccinated without them finding out, and in the case where they do, then it's likely that their relationship with me would turn for the worse for a while. Has anyone had a similar experience with me, and even if you did or didn't, do you have any suggestions for what I do about it? Any answers will be greatly appreciated, and once again, I am pro-vaccine and not against vaccinations.",2022-01-07,4,POST

Does this mean I have no immunity against the Covid 19 virus?  I know J&J is less powerful but negative antibodies for the spike protein means zero immunity like the unvaccinated?

In April, I (33F then) had a bad reaction to Pfizer #1, with upper left arm pain, pins and needles, and twitching that spread to the rest of my body. My left leg gave out, my limbs got extremely heavy in the mornings to the point that I couldn't move them, and I had heart palpitations, fever, night sweats, etc. This went on for 6-8 weeks and was a nightmare. My doctors didn't diagnose me with anything other than it appeared to be nerve-related.
In late November/early December, I thought I had a bad cold. That is, until my left arm hurt and had pins and needles down to the same fingers as last time (ring and pinky). I thought, ""Huh. That's weird. That hasn't happened since I got the vaccine... uh oh. I should get tested."" So I did, and lo and behold, it was COVID. It's like my immune system ""remembered"" to attack the virus, but also ""remembered"" to attack the same nerves it did last time, starting with my left arm. As the days wore on, it's like I had a miniature replay of my vaccine reaction with my left leg being numb, twitches, my heart rate speeding up, etc. but it was not nearly as bad as my actual vaccine reaction from before.
I do not have a family history of autoimmune conditions, nor of any nerve issues. This was completely new.

Since this has happened, we've been collectively exposed to COVID multiple times but never developed an infection or any symptoms of an infection. In one of these circumstances, we were in the same room as a CV+ individual without being masked for 5 hours. 
In November, we were boosted by the Moderna booster and developed literally zero side effects; not even added tiredness that is commonly reported. 
 Is not having any symptoms after a booster normal? With the omicron variant going around I'm beginning to re-evaluate how concerned I should be and how protected I am. Is the fact that the booster provided no side effects normal? I know they stated the J&J vaccine was less effective, but honestly I felt way more protected after having the severe reaction because I KNOW my immune system was positively responding.

i didn't end up going to the hospital because my headache was more of a minor annoyance than anything else. ibuprofen pretty much kept it under control. i feel like anxiety and caffeine made it worse, too. i was only really concerned because of how long it lasted. 
it cleared up entirely a few days after i posted. it took about two weeks after the shot for the symptoms to disappear. coincidentally, from what i have heard,the vaccine is most effective after two weeks. unfortunately j&j is a bit weaker against the new variant but at least if i get sick i'll be less likely to spread it. 
a comment had mentioned that those who are prone to migraines are more likely to have a prolonged headache ""activated"" by the vaccine. i'm not prone to migraines persay, but my mom is. it mightve been a random hereditary thing. i only ever get headaches when i stare at a large screen for way too long or drink too much coffee.

I have no idea about his vaccine status, but he and his wife were barely masked on the flight (but their children and grandchildren were properly masked) but the man and hi wife were coughing nonstop in the row right behind me. 
Almost 4 hours left in our 16 hour flight, he loses consciousness. He responds after a minute but the alarming thing was his oxygen levels were at 60-65%. At first, his family tried to explain that it was his high pressure, diabetes, long journey, lack of exercise, lack of appetite, etc. Soon, the crew was on their 2nd oxygen tank when they realized his oxygen saturation levels weren‚Äôt staying in the 80s. They kept dropping back to the 60s. 
By the end of the flight, they went through four oxygen tanks (one 2L and three 4L) and his oxygen saturation was only at 75%. Even when they escorted him off the flight, he or his son either refused medical treatment (and weren‚Äôt tested for COVID), and he was just in a wheelchair near baggage claim. His mask, still at his chin like nothing had happened.
Long story short, I was double masked on a 16 hour flight but still exposed (taking mask off for eating/drinking) to an elderly man who had a textbook case of COVID. How concerned should I be?",2022-01-04,0,POST

I received my shot 24 hours ago and am feeling FABULOUS. 
Immediately after my shot (11am), I had a minor panic attack but a few in the nose and out the mouth breathing exercises calmed me pretty fast. Sat for 15 minutes and then left the CVS and drove home. Minor stomach pain/cramping throughout the day. At around 2pm my arm was aching and by 5 I couldn‚Äôt move it above my head. Took an Advil and sat in bed with an icepack on my arm and watched Netflix and took a mini nap. By 6ish my arm was feeling WAY better and I could move it above my head again. Ended up continuing to watch Netflix, had dinner, and fell asleep. Just woke up feeling great! Arm is mobile and has no pain. Only other side effect I have is a little bit of chest pain around my heart. Could be anxiety or the coffee I drank.

For the unvaccinated, I‚Äôve yet to find official guidance for protection that goes beyond vaccines and boosters. We‚Äôre finding that Omicron is more capable than prior variants of spreading even among masked groups.
At what point is it necessary for the unvaccinated to take extreme precautions where they require those around them to make major sacrifices like ceasing all activities where indoor interactions occur(even with masks), like going to work?
I‚Äôm unvaccinated and live with four people who are vaccinated and boosted. since the risk of being infected seems to still exist every time someone returns from work/store, the most precautionary things are extreme and seem to be either quarantine everyone from non-household contacts,meaning quit jobs, or have each member of house wear N95 at all times at home?
These are extreme precautions that
would obviously be immensely difficult. I need to know just how imperative it is for me to sit down with the people in my house and ask them to do this. The White House briefing on 12/17 contained a pretty harrowing address to unvaccinated-
‚ÄúFor the unvaccinated, you‚Äôre looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.‚Äù
Seemingly this is a death sentence for every unvaccinated person, and for those like me who are still not allowed to get vaccinated, are we to understand that becoming infected will result in death, so I need to ask my household to make major life changes 
like quitting jobs/not going to stores, or n95s for every person at all times in the home? These seem near impossible to request but if the stakes require these extreme precautions I need to know. 
I understand that the population i am in is small, but it‚Äôs not zero and I can‚Äôt be alone in my frustration to find guidance to protect myself beyond vaccines alone, with no guidance beyond hearing that the unvaccinated will die.

- I am healthy, not vaccinated and never contracted Covid
- I do use masks and respect distancing 
- I believe the pharmaceutical industry is hiding the dangerous side effects of vaccines and silencing health professionals from speaking up
- I think vaccines are not safe and since I can still contract the disease while vaccinated and the labs can't be sued if I develop side effects, I would rather not get vaxxed

In addtion to that lately I am also having what I think it's 'paresthesia' (a weird cold/wet feeling on my left cheek) that goes on and off for days now. Tonight, to make things worse, I also start to feel tingling under on my left foot.... I went to the ER few days ago and got a CT scan. All clear, my BP was elevated. They advised me to go see a neurologist as soon as possible but the earliest appointment I could get is in one month!
Have you experienced anything similar? if so, did it eventually go away? I am just scared this progresses instead of getting better.... I am 43, before the vaccine I was healthy. I eat clean, workout regularly, don't drink, don't smoke. I pray to feel normal again soon.",2022-01-02,7,POST

I went into the ER today because I‚Äôve been having heart palpitations and feeling like my heart is skipping a beat and occasional shortness of breath and feeling lightheaded. I got my booster shot of Pfizer 2 weeks ago after originally getting 2 Pfizer doses and thought that these symptoms would go away but they ended up coming back. The doctors did an EKG and blood tests and found that I have myocarditis likely from my booster shot. I‚Äôm waiting on meeting with a cardiologist to do an ultrasound and look at treatment options.

449,rttttn,19F Moderna Booster Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rttttn/19f_moderna_booster_experience/,CovidVaccinated,"Hi all! I‚Äôve posted my experiences with the first two vaccines here back in Jan/Feb and thought I‚Äôd update with my booster experience since this sub has helped me a lot.
I had pretty severe side effects with the first two shots, fever, chills, body aches, really high heart rate, etc, so I was feeling like I might not need to get the booster. Honestly, as a young person, I think even though it‚Äôs recommended, there‚Äôs more of a personal risk benefit analysis that every young individual should do. We‚Äôre right on the cusp on increased risk for heart problems and less likely to get severe disease, so it‚Äôs more of a decision that needs to be made. I personally decided to get it because it‚Äôs been so long since my first two doses and because my college requires it, as well as wanting the extra protection, but with the heart symptoms I experienced last time it was a little scary. That said, here‚Äôs a timeline of my symptoms thus far, I‚Äôll try to continue to update.
12/31 2:15: received the dose (half dose moderna) the nurses checked in on whether I should get it with my previous heart symptoms, but decided it would be fine. I felt just a little out of it right after, but it could just be anxiety.
3:30: some palpitations and generally just feeling like I need to sit down. Not feeling too bad.
4:00-9:00: feeling decent, not like the first two and still able to get up and do things. Slightly high heart rate. Arm starts to be really sensitive and painful, my lymph node is huge and tender. 
9:00: started to feel shitty, headache, felt like my eyes were popping out.
10:00: light nausea, body aches starting, some chills. 
12:00: finally able to sleep after Advil, Still uncomfy. So much for partying on NYE amiright
5:45: woke up, weird dreams, laying in cold sweat and very uncomfortable. Took another Advil.
6:00-12:00: severe body aches, can‚Äôt get comfortable, cold, and when I touch my skin it feels tingly or kind of burny. Took another Advil at 10.
1:00: starting to feel a little better, still bedridden with body aches but overall better. Hopefully it‚Äôs not just the advil. Still having chills but it‚Äôs also 11 degrees outside, so maybe it‚Äôs that.
3:45: feeling worse now, even with another Advil. Super hot and have chills occasionally.
I was feeling like crap all night. Fever and chills and super achy. I also had a bad cough, which they say is absolutely not a side effect of the vaccine, but definitely is. It‚Äôs gone now with my other side effects and I‚Äôve only had it after getting each shot. Now this morning I‚Äôm almost back to fully feeling good other than my lymph node being super swollen and painful. And still slightly high heart rate. Overall, it was about 36 hours of bad symptoms for me. I‚Äôm going to refuse getting another booster for a looooong time‚Ä¶these side effects are ridiculous and I‚Äôm young, it‚Äôs a sliding scale of risk benefit.
Update a week later: feeling fine now, a little tired, but I think it‚Äôs just from doing a lot last week. Overall fine experience, but I don‚Äôt want another one.",2022-01-02,3,POST

If it matters, I'm 30/F (31 in 2022, but eh).
1. My appointment is at 8pm. Which means after dinner. Should I eat dinner or not? Should I skip dinner completely? Should I bring a snack?
2. I've stalked as many reddit covid vaccine threads as I can find (hah) but what were your experiences on P+P+M, especially if youre 19-39?
3. Should I take meds (idk, paracetamol/ibuprofen/anti-emetics/whatever/help) before and/or immediately after my vax? Or should I just have them on standby till I slowly burn hahahaha
4. Primarily my mind was made up (distance to centre + vax combi effectiveness), but like - I will still go but I'm freaking out. Cos I heard from my sister that her friend (also 30/F, triple Moderna) had a bad experience with her booster. Like nausea/vomiting kind of bad (I'm currently at like ""please don't barf on yourself in the observation"")
3b. Yeah so I don't really wanna barf acid through my nose (... which is why I should eat) but I also don't wanna barf my dinner all over myself (... which is why like I'm afraid to eat dinner). Can I like, take a pill an hour before the vax or something WHAT DO I DO.
3c. I also considered bringing a barf bag but I now think thats a terrible idea cos out of sight, out of mind.
Essentially I didn't have any GI effects on my Pfizer (but omg arm x tired) and I'm terrified to have them on Moderna ... what do I do to like stem it/stop it/prevent it ... or do I just pray I don't get luck of the draw lol.
I'll be ok to take the next day (or two) off if needed but I absolutely cannot handle having to barf as a result of this vax :( ... worse if its in the middle of the night!!!

This is my experience taking 2 doses of Pfizer and the Moderna Booster.
1st dose of Pfizer - July
The arm pain was quiet obvious along with some drowsiness. The thing that worried me about this 1st dose was I felt a slight bit of chest pain, it could have just been paranoia as well due to the reports of lots of people having myocarditis from it.
2nd dose of Pfizer - August
Same as 1st dose, a bit of arm pain, I don't recall any chest pain.
Booster dose of Moderna - December
This one hit like a TRUCK. I took the booster around 12pm, initially I didn't feel much, just some arm pain. Around 8-10 hours later, sometime in the evening, I felt the side effects full force, I began to shiver like mad and my heart rate went through the roof.   
I couldn't even warm up next to my heater under the bed sheets, the shivers were that bad. It got worse for a couple of minutes and eventually peaked, there was also a bit of nausea accompanying all of this and I felt like the room was spinning all over the place.  
This lasted for a couple of hours, eventually I woke up around 2 am in the night and it started to get better, I went from feeling extremely cold to feeling too hot which I assume was a fever.
Throughout the night it got better and eventually I could feel my temperature return to normal. At the moment I have an annoying headache and just feel exhausted, arm pain is also still there.

While I am fine, I am not quite sure that I will get a second shot. It seems everyone that I talked to had the ‚Äúbad‚Äù side effects when they took the second dose.
I wonder if there‚Äôs anyone here who only took on dose and just run with it. I wonder how has your experience been?",2021-12-31,13,POST

Has anyone else experienced this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rstix1/f19_numbnessweakness_and_tingling_in_limbs_mostly/,CovidVaccinated,"I am 92 hours post moderna booster and most of my symptoms have disappeared. However, I started feeling some pins and needles type tingling sensation in my knees on the second day after my vaccine and it feels more prominent today - probably because I'm up and moving about. My knees feel super weak and wobbly and I'm having some weakness in my calves too. It kinda feels like when you get hit in the funny bone and your leg turns to jelly. The tingling is more present when I'm sat/laid down. There's also a similar sensation in my elbows and wrists though they feel more stiff/overworked and weak, but it's very slight. I don't necessarily feel faint as such. I was able to walk to the shop and back with no issue but it felt like my legs were going to give out. Has anyone else experienced something like this ? How long did it take to go away for you? Should I be worried? Please be gentle, I suffer from extreme health anxiety and tend to find it difficult to gauge if it's all in my head or not. Thank you !
Edit: it has progressed into a tingling cold feeling in my legs, mostly in my calves. If it's not improved by morning I'm going to call 111 and see if I should go to hospital. I'm scared it's GBS. I'm scared I'm gonna lose my life. I'm scared",2021-12-31,40,POST

Pre Booster - Was suffering from a bit of a cold/chest infection and was over the worst of it.
18/12 Booster - Was planning to leave booster till after Christmas as I‚Äôd just been suffering from chest congestion but took gf for her booster and there was no queue so just seized the opportunity 
First 24 hours - No real issues bar the typical covid arm
23/12 - Flew to gfs family home for Christmas and began to experience slight back pain upper left side (side of vaccine) 
27/12 - Still experiencing mild intermittent back pain and noticed armpit was slightly sore when squeezing arm against it. Noticed a firm moveable lump under the skin of the armpit around 2cm in size
31/12 - Still experiencing mild pain around the shoulder, particularly the back of it. Mostly localised but sometimes radiates slightly to neck or side of ribs. Lump is still in armpit too and hasn‚Äôt grown but not shrunk much either.
Other - A couple of months prior to the vaccine I was experiencing ulnar nerve numbness in this side which cleared up after a couple of weeks. Don‚Äôt feel any numbness or anything on fingers at present 
From reading on here I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a swollen lymph node. I don‚Äôt usually check my lymph nodes regularly so it may have swollen up earlier than the date specified but that is when I noticed it.
Anyone else experience this or have any tips?",2021-12-31,2,POST

This is a pretty in depth timeline stating my symptoms as they happened, and also my emotions and anxieties experienced throughout. I suffer from EXTREME health anxiety and emetophobia and I just want to show that if I can do it, you definitely can ! (Sidenote: n* - nausea, v* - vomit/vomiting, Tu* - throw up/threw up. The subreddit this was originally posted to censors these words as they can be triggering to us emets)
Just got my moderna booster after my initial 2 vaccinations were Pfizer and wanted to create a symptom timeline as I experience them to hopefully put others at ease and encourage you all to get vaccinated !!
Just want to preface this by saying I experienced very mild side effects with my first two doses (I have symptom timelines of those too on my profile!) and didn't have any n* or v* for either of those. I am 19F and have not had covid before or after my vaccines (as of yet). The moderna booster (at least the one I received) is also only a half dose instead of a full one.
MONDAY
4:10pm - time of vaccination
5:17pm - slightly numb arm, feeling a little weak and dizzy though that is probably from anxiety
6:14pm - shaking and feeling weak though I think it's because I need to eat. Currently making myself some pasta with tomato sauce and broccoli as it's a safe food. Taking some paracetamol (Tylenol) as a precautionary measure
6:54pm - shaking and weak feeling still present after eating. I've taken some Rennie chewy tablets and I'm gonna have an antiemetic before I go to sleep. Generally just feel like I'm coming down with something and it's freaking me out but I think I'll manage. No n* as of yet I don't think, if there is it's caused by anxiety
7:30pm - think I'm coming down with a slight fever and I feel EXHAUSTED. I'm way too anxious to sleep in case I Tu* in the night. I can't stop having panic attacks I hate this so so much. I've got a headache coming on too I just feel so horribly drained and anxious I'm so so scared
9:17pm - took some ibuprofen about an hour ago and I'm feeling a little better. Still achey and tired but more hungry than n* ! Haha. I'm gonna try calm down and get some sleep soon
TUESDAY
4:34am - tossed and turned and was finally able to get to sleep at around 1:30, now ive woken up 3 hours later completely unable to sleep. I don't think it's anything to do with the vaccine, just a restless night. The general acheyness has gone but now my arm absolutely kills and I have a bit of a headache. Feeling super duper hungry !! Think I might go make myself some toast and a drink then attempt to sleep again after
10:16am - I got another 4 and half hours or so of sleep but I'm feeling super exhausted. The mild limb achiness is back and my arm where I got the injection hurts sO bad. I've got some mild anxiety n* because when I think of food I feel more frightened than n*. Also think I'm feeling n* because I'm hungry. I'm gonna make myself some toast and a coffee in a bit
11:10am - forced myself to eat a crumpet and I'm really freaking out I think I'm n* but I don't know. I've taken some more paracetamol and ibuprofen for the aches and pains and if the n* gets bad I'm gonna take an antisickness tablet. I'm 19 hours post Vax now so I think this is when the symptoms will peak. I can't tell if the n* is real or caused by anxiety or even there at all. My throat feels tight and my stomach feels hollow and I'm scared to even sip water. I think the reason I'm so anxious is because these body aches and this general feeling of unwellness is exactly how I felt when I last tu* as a kid
12:57pm - started feeling n* so I've taken a cyclizine tablet because I think it feels real this time. I need to use the toilet for a BM but I'm too scared in case the sight of the loo triggers me to v* . My face hurts and I feel generally run down but hopefully I'll be back to normal by tomorrow. I'm glad I got my booster, I just wish it could have been Pfizer :( I'm gonna try nap to make up for how horribly I slept last night
1:19pm - I just got a huge wave of n* and sharted feeling really hot and sweaty and dizzy. My throat is so dry but I'm scared because I still feel so so n* and I think it's gonna happen. I've got a bucket by my bed but I'm gonna try go to the bathroom if it does. I'm scared
7:12pm - the antisickness tablet made me sleep for 5 hours. I just woke up thinking it was early morning the next day but it's only 7pm. I feel so weak and achey and nauseous. My stomach feels completely hollow.  I know realistically I need to eat but I know it's just gonna make me n* again. I need to take painkillers again but I know if I take them on an empty stomach it'll make it worse. I'm gonna try some antacids and another antisickness tablet. I just want to be better. I hate this.
7:40pm - just got up to go get some paracetamol and I am so weak and shaky. I have literally 0 strength or energy. Everything aches and all I can think about is my stomach. I've had some chewy Rennie tablets so I'm gonna give those about half an hour to kick in then take my meds and go back to sleep. I'm exhausted
WEDNESDAY
1:57pm - slept for another 5 hours or so. I seem to be experiencing this really strange insomnia ?? I can only sleep if I take my antisickness tablets (which are antihistamines so they make me drowsy) and even then it's fitful. I'm gonna have some more paracetamol and another antacid. I still feel n* but not as bad as before. Gonna keep sipping water because my tongue feels like cotton wool it's so so dry. I can't tell if I feel better or worse, I just know everything is shaky and hurting and the side effects of my antisickness meds are kicking my ass
10:43am - I did wake up in the middle of the night again, around 4 I think? Just feeling super floaty and dizzy as a side effect of the antisickness tablets. I did eventually manage to get back to sleep and here I am now. I'm feeling a little better! Still not 100% but not as weak and shaky as before. I'm gonna try eat some plain bread or crackers in a bit as if I do v* I want there to be something to Tu* , otherwise it'll hurt and be so much worse than it needs to be. The n* is a little milder this morning :) I'm sipping water as I've been having some crazy night sweats and the last thing I need is dehydration. I've decided I'm not gonna take anymore antisickness tablets because the side effects are horrendous, and if I do I'm only gonna take half. Hopefully by this time tomorrow I'll be feeling better still
11:45am - I think I'm dehydrated. Super shaky and weak and dizzy, really bad dry mouth and feeling thirsty but too scared to eat or drink in case it makes me sick. My mum is coming home and I think we're gonna call 111 and see what they say. I'm scared
12:38pm - ate a plain slice of bread about an hour ago and I'm sipping water again. I feel a little less shaky and weak now ! Eating is scary but I'd rather be sick than have to go to hospital due to not eating/drinking. Hopefully I'm on the mend now :)
1:32pm - still feeling a little out of it and sleepy but definitely better :) just watching YouTube and dozing. I'm still dizzy and weak when I stand up but not so much when I lay down ! My mouth isn't dry anymore and my tongue feels significantly less cottony. Fingers crossed I continue to improve !
2:34pm - just had another piece of bread and I have a feeling it might have been a mistake. The n* is back :( if it happens i just wanna get it over and done with quickly. I'm proud of myself for how I've dealt with this so far ! If it does happen hopefully afterwards I'll feel a little better and it won't be as painful because I've actually eaten and drank something ! Will continue to keep you all updated
4pm - 48 hours post Vax now and hoping the worst of it is over. The n* died down on its own, I think I just have to be careful when eating. The key to feeling semi okay is paracetamol and ibuprofen every 4 hours ! I'm just dozing on and off now, still seem to be experiencing some slight side effects from my last cyclizine though. I feel a little out of it, like I can't quite get a grasp on the day or time. Here's to hoping I'll be better tomorrow :)
6:57pm - feeling a little better again ! Eaten some crackers, got a wash and changed my pyjamas, currently watching a film with my mum. Hoping I'll sleep better tonight :)
10:13pm - I've perked up considerably ! My side effects started improving massively roughly 48 hours after they began which is something I've heard has happened with lots of other people. Still mild n* when I eat but nowhere near v* level! Aside from that just an overall unwell achey feeling that is definitely improving. Just hope I can sleep through the night tonight üò≠
THURSDAY
1:43am - ugh I am SO SICK OF THIS N* !!! i think it's partially from reflux but it's super uncomfortable and making it hard to sleep. Gonna take some more Rennie tablets
1:59am - okay okay I gave in and took another cyclizine. But only because the n* was preventing me from sleeping !! I'm hoping this will clear the last of it off and I'll feel better in the morning
10:02am - just woke up and I am feeling SIGNIFICANTLY better !! Appetite still isn't 100% back to normal but my body no longer aches horribly and I feel somewhat aware of my surroundings haha. Craving a coffee but I feel that may be a mistake
11:58am - eating peanut butter toast, gonna get dressed and go buy some bananas as I'm craving some. Still feel a little shaky and weak and not quite right but I know that I'll just continue to improve from now on. Anxiety is creeping in which isn't too fun. Just gonna be gentle with myself and try go about my day as normal
3:41pm - the n* is borderline unbearable at this point. The doctors are refusing to prescribe me any antisickness tablets. I'm gonna at least get some sleeping tablets because there's no way in hell I'll be able to sleep while I feel this unwell. The anticipation is killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm scared
3:55pm - crying in a heap on the bathroom floor. The doctor suggested I'm coming down with a stomach bug? I'm so scared
5:23pm - I can't stop shaking with anxiety. I'm cold. I'm having bad heart palpitations. I just want this to end now I'm so tired I can't do this anymore I can't pretend to be brave any longer. I'm so scared I'll wake up in the middle of the night tonight and be s* . I'm so tired
6:19pm - the nausea has gone and now I'm a little hungry. I'm gonna wait til tomorrow to eat though because I can't sleep when I'm n* . Hopefully the n* will be gone by tomorrow but I'm not feeling too positive about it. I'm so exhausted at this point I just want it to be over
FRIDAY
9:46 - slept horribly - I think I'm experiencing insomnia as a side effect? - but 95% back to normal now ! Having some crazy anxiety and the symptoms of that are throwing me off (feeling like I'm moving in slow motion, shakiness, weak knees, heart palpitations, jumping vision, sudden dropping sensation) but it's nothing I haven't experienced before. I don't think I'm n* anymore but the anxiety and trauma of the state I was in yesterday is telling me not to eat or drink. I want a coffee and a banana though üò≠.

494,rsg7ys,"My experience (shortness of breath, chest pain, hives - any advice welcomed)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rsg7ys/my_experience_shortness_of_breath_chest_pain/,CovidVaccinated,"Hello all. I wanted to share my experience after getting the Moderna booster, with as much information as possible included (sorry for the TLDR), in the hope that I could hear from others who have been through similar experiences.
First thing I should say, I am 100% pro vaccine and remain that way today. I received the first two doses of Moderna back in April with no issues other than the usual flu like symptoms for a day or two. Fast forward to November 22nd when I decided to go ahead and get my booster, and was given Moderna for a third time. This is when the ‚Äúfun‚Äù started in what has been an extremely difficult and stressful month for me.
I should also mention that I am a relatively healthy 31yo male who runs several miles a week and has never had any allergies or breathing issues before this.
My initial response to the booster was a stronger reaction than the first two shots, although still nothing alarming (low grade fever, chills, etc.). By the 48 hour mark I was feeling mostly okay and even managed to go for a jog. But later that night, I began to notice numbness in the two small fingers on my left hand (the side I was jabbed FWIW). Over the next week, I experienced varying degrees of numbness in my other hand, my face, and to a lesser degree my arms and feet.
Then, just as soon as the numbness began to die down I woke up one morning feeling‚Ä¶ itchy. I later realized I had developed some kind of rash or hives that seemed to be appearing and disappearing all over my body. I also started to feel increasingly short of breath, which worsened over the next several days. Eventually, on 12/7 I decided to go to the ER when I felt like I was struggling to maintain an adequate supply of air. (I had not been to a doctor yet at this point, probably my mistake.)
At the ER, they did the standard blood tests as well as a CT scan to check for a blood clot (D-dimer was high), but everything came back clean and I was prescribed a six day course of prednisone. The shortness of breath improved greatly over the next few days, although the hives persisted. On 12/13 I followed up with my PCP who diagnosed me with dermatographia (aka skin writing which matched the symptoms) and told me to try taking Zyrtec (I have never taken an allergy medication in my life).
As soon as I began taking Zyrtec, the itchiness went away completely and the hives mostly went away (I still get red marks very occasionally but they aren‚Äôt itchy). But at this point, the shortness of breath returned and that has been my main problem ever since.
Over the last two weeks, the breathing difficulties have persisted and even gotten worse over the last several days. (This is despite the fact that I have been on a second course of prednisone, which had seemed to help previously.) I have also started feeling tightness in my chest that has become more persistent as well (I wouldn‚Äôt quite call it pain, maybe a dull pain). The tightness is generally directly below my collarbone. I will also sometimes feel a bit of ‚Äúflutteriness‚Äù although it‚Äôs hard to describe. Sustained activity makes everything worse, and it doesn‚Äôt take much - even a 15 minute walk around my block had me feeling horrible. I generally feel the best in the morning and the worst at night. Lying on my stomach seems to help.
Some other info that may be relevant - my resting heart rate has always been very consistently in the low-ish 50s, but it went up to the low 60s around the time I went to the ER, back down to the mid-50s while taking the prednisone, back up to the low 60s after I stopped taking it, and now back down to 56-57 currently (although my breathing issues are actually worse). Not sure what to make of it.
Also, I did visit my PCP again on 12/23 and they did more blood work and an EKG that all came back normal.
If you read through all of this, I sincerely thank you as I am really just searching for answers. I have an appointment with a cardiologist but it is not until 1/11, and in the meantime my mental and physical health are taking a bit of a beating. Would greatly appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced something similar.",2021-12-31,58,POST

i exercise a lot and when i exercise i feel a dull pressure in my upper back between shoulder blades - and then the feeling of needing to burp. it‚Äôs like gas is trapped..
i‚Äôve had acid reflux maybe once or twice a year if i eat junk food. i regularly have an upset tummy though‚Ä¶ 
but last night i woke up at 1am and the burning sensation started in my tummy and went all the way up my throat - i couldn‚Äôt sleep for 3 hours due to every time laying down it would start. i haven‚Äôt had it like this. 
i am on a meal plan so i eat the same diet every day - nothing has changed.
no ‚Äòspicy‚Äô food as the doctor said it may be. 
I really worked myself up about this vaccine and was very anxious leading up to it and still now.
i think at the start i made my self physically sick ‚Äòhot flushes, headache, pains‚Äô because of how anxious i was.
going for my 2nd shot next week but i just don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
the doctor said this isn‚Äôt a side effect but it‚Äôs just strange ever since i got the vaccine when i been walking/exercising this feeling comes on.
i really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my anxiety. one minute i‚Äôm feeling fine next minute i am in a state of absolute panic thinking the vaccine is negatively affecting me.
currently off work as it‚Äôs mandated at my workplace‚Ä¶ 
no income for time off
meant to be going back next week after 2nd shot but i don‚Äôt know i feel anxious and would like to see if the issues dissolve.
spoke to a pharmacist and he said it could be my autoimmune way of dealing with the vaccine and safe to get 2nd dose.

513,rrsvaa,Insane Pfizer side effects,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rrsvaa/insane_pfizer_side_effects/,CovidVaccinated,"hi, i'm 15 and got my pfizer shot in late july or so. after the second dose i had an insane fever and couldn't sleep that night, but feeling shitty after your second dose is pretty common.
however, in the beginning of august i noticed that wounds that i had like cuts or scratches from my cat, and even mosquito bites i had gotten that summer had begun flaring up and swelling - they looked similar to kelloids. i didn't think much of it as sometimes this happened. however, after a while it got worse. somewhat like folliculitis, my hair follicles would swell like pimples, and when i scratched them it popped. oh, and remember those scratches i mentioned? they grew horribly infected. there was a mixture of shingles, chickenpox, dyshidrosis, and folliculitis on every part of my body - blisters, rashes, scabs, sores, everything. they would always be leaking a smelly yellow fluid and it itched like crazy. my pediatrician also practices dermatology and she didn't know what was happening. one time my arm got so red and swollen my mom basically dragged me to the ER and we waited for 5 hours in the cold there to see what that was about. thankfully it wasn't anything TOO serious and i was prescribed some antibiotics and a hibiclens soap to wash my body (side note: i didn't shower because everytime i did the water would make everything worse and it was too painful). i visited at least 3 doctors and was given a variety of different medicine - liquid steroid, some antibiotic cream, antibiotic and antivirus pills, a bunch of other creams and liquid i don't remember. they all had no idea what was wrong, or gave me all kinds of different diagnoses. every single inch of my body there would be a sore or blister and they all leaked that horrible yellow fluid. i couldn't sleep and would often end up rolling around until 5am before i managed to pass out. i couldn't wear clothing that covered my arms and legs because my wounds would stick to any fabric it touches and got torn off - which is exactly why i couldn't sleep as i was a sticky, itchy mess. had to walk around in a tank top and underwear all day lol. my bedsheets were stained with yellow and blood. the blisters on my hand were so large that i could barely type nor do something so simple such as opening a doorknob, and there were blisters on my feet and i had to waddle around on the edges of my feet because it was so painful. i wanted to cry every single day but avoided doing so as it was hard to rub my tears away with these horrid hands. i missed 3 weeks worth of school because of it. worst time of my life EVER, i would never wish it on my worst enemy
now it's december and i'm STILL suffering from whatever it was that i had. it's not as bad but the infections are starting to come back again and i already have a few sores on my body. as for the rest they all turned into ugly brown scars that are like dots all over my body. it'll take a year or more for them to fade away.

i have severe health anxiety and felt panicked before each vaccine, only to experience side effects that were so minimal they didn't interfere at all with my day to day. i know it can be nerve wracking not to know what to expect with regard to side effects, but far and away, the most unpleasant part of getting each of my shots was my own anxiety.

So a little background:
I received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the summer. After the first dose, I experienced a little bit of chest pain the night of the vaccine (maybe a 3/10). By the next morning, the pain was gone. Part of me wondered if it was the vaccine, anxiety or something else. 
After dose two, I had 7-8/10 chest pain. The pain could be described as an occasional lightning bolt feeling in my chest. I did not go into the ER or anything. Just went to bed (I know) and woke up the next morning, pain free. 
Now with boosters mandated (I am a registered nurse), I am concerned that my chest pain after the booster could get even worse. I talked to my primary care provider and she suggested I do the moderna booster instead of continuing with Pfizer. 
I would love to hear from anyone that had Pfizer to start and later switched to moderna. Or anyone that had similar symptoms to mine. 
Part of me is nervous but I also think it‚Äôs reasonable to try switching manufacturers. But let me make it clear that I don‚Äôt want anti-vax rhetoric. Just curious to see if anyone had a similar experience and/or success stories.",2021-12-30,3,POST

I am fully vaccinated. I required all of my extended family currently living in my house to get fully vaccinated as well because our HCP recommended it. I am not anti-science by any means. My understanding is that when you are fully vaccinated you can still carry the virus that causes COVID and pass it along to people unknowingly if proper precautions aren‚Äôt adhered to. The vaccine is intended to protect the vaccinated individual as far as I understand. 
I think I understand the thought process behind requiring negative tests before allowing entrance to a property. But if you can carry the virus vaccinated or not vaccinated, what sense does it make to require vaccination before entering IF you are masking properly?

I'm about to take my booster in 2 days, but I'm slightly concerned with the way the authorities are handling it, this isn't meant to be an anti-vax post or anything, I'm just curious.
My 2nd dose of Pfizer was taken on the 4th of August 2021. Initially, the authorities imposed a limit of 6 months from the 2nd dose for the booster, meaning I could take it not earlier than the 4th of February 2022.
Suddenly, this 6 month rule vanished and I'm told to come take it in 2 days time? Now I'm trying to understand what made them suddenly remove this 6 month rule? It seems random.
The final concern is the mixing of vaccines, at the moment the booster shot being offered is Moderna only yet the vaccine doses I took where Pfizer, has anyone had experience with this? Does it seem safe to mix them?

Anyway we and my partner are suppose to be going travelling soon to three countries which will require quarantine if I am not vaccinated, my partner has said this is making her very anxious, that she is upset because all of her friends and family have been saying not nice things about me choosing not to have the jab, last night she said please consider it to protect your mother and father and be empathetic, she said that unvaccinated spread the virus less, so I sent her some research about how peak viral loads could potentially be similar among vaccinated individuals vs unvaccinated.
The truth is my decision will effect her because if I do not have it done I will have to quarantine for 10 days, she will be alone in the country.
Do you think I am being unfair here?
Because part of me now is thinking maybe I need to reconsider my stance on this and potentially get the vaccine and take the risk.

I admit I didn't properly do my research before consenting to taking AstraZeneca vaccine despite hearing some controversy relatsed to it.

The night of the 25th, I think, I developed a sore throat, but I thought this was just because I wasn't eating enough daily to keep healthy and I slept in a cold room for a couple nights. The 26th I woke up a tiny bit stuffy, which I thought was because that night my room was a lot warmer. I didn't take a COVID test then despite my throat still being sore. The 27th, my sore throat had persisted and I took a rapid test. Negative. 
I think I still have a minor bit of a sore throat. It isn't scratchy at all though, and it isn't even achey. It's a very... vague pain throughout my throat... if that makes sense. 
I had a headache for a couple days as well, but I'm a bit of a caffeine addict and had much less caffeine than usual for a few days so I thought that was the reason why. 
Should I test again? Should I be isolating? 
Also, the test I used was BinaxNow. My negative test the 27th was after a throat swab + nostrils swab. I did this following Twitter advice to do so (possibly foolish of me) because people have been saying Omicron is in the throat more than the nose. UK tests do both throat and nose swabs. My only concern is that this messed up my test and maybe gave me a false negative. It seems so much more likely that could give a false positive, though... I'm just not sure.",2021-12-29,1,POST

I tested positive for COVID three days later. Nothing to do with the booster. i Just got COVID.  
My lymph node started swelling on day 3. I had this huge lump under my armpit. Tis lasted for 3 days.  
I started getting acne breakouts all over my face. Still getting them as a I write, 7 days in. Every day 2 new cystic sores are appearing on my face.  
About the same time (so 5 days in) my mood has dropped dramatically. Getting out of bed in the morning is hard. I just feel depressed and can't be bothered to do anything. Can't concentrate on anything.  
My theory is the vax has screwed with my hormone levels. I've read that it has destablisied periods for women. I don't have ovaries but I know from past experience my mental state and mood are very closely linked to my hormone levels.  
I already was double vaxxed when I got COVID. Actually I'm still testing positive now. I had zero symptoms. No headache, fever, chills, cough etc. Not even a runny nose.

Update 6h: So 3 hours ago my arm started to hurt a bit, it's really nothing I cannot ignore. That's all, I'm fine. Unless there is something new, I'll make an update before sleeping in about another 6h more.
Update 12h: My arm got a bit worse, still not enough to make me take any pill. No fever, I feel normal. Going to sleep.
Update 20h: No change in my arm. I slept normal, as far as I can tell I haven't had fever. I do feel a little bit... like drunk? I'm going to call it brain fog, I'm not really sure that's what you call it in English, mentally tired is a good description.
Update 26h: After my last update, I went back to the bed for a couple of hours. Now I'm back to myself, the arm pain is going down.",2021-12-28,2,POST

I got two doses of moderna back in march. I got very bad side effects (arthritis like pain for 6 months + and still going on today).
My rheumatologist fully agrees it was caused by the vaccine after running a lot of test and doesn‚Äôt want me to get the booster. He‚Äôs willing to fill whatever paper needed.
However my understanding is that even with a counter indication you can‚Äôt use it to get in indoor places and can‚Äôt use a pass like NY excelsior.

I wasn‚Äôt convinced. So I went and got tested but the test just came back negative the same day.

I‚Äôm terrified something like that could happen to me. The reason why I‚Äôm terrified is because as far as i am concerned, we have no clue as to why that happens. Soo terrified me more. 
Now mind you i completely understand there has been hundreds of million administered doses with 0 issues. Yet being in that small tiny % scares me, cause i don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll do in my body.
I hope i can get rid of this fear. I did try once to get the vaccine, as i was waiting in the waiting room 30 mins later, i chicken out.

# 1. If he now wants to get fully vaccinated, should he disclose what happened or would he  get into trouble?

I will be getting my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on the 27th. I'm in my early 30s, male, and I am a bit worried about being one of the few unlucky people to experience serious adverse side effects. I've been so nervous about the vaccine and have postponed it as long as I could. I've been working from home all year, but that needs to stop in February because they need me back in the office. 
At this point I need to get vaccinated. I am very worried because of two health conditions I've had in the past, varicose veins (both internal and superficial) as well as heart murmur and an iregular heartbeat.  Also had some allergies to medication to the past including penicillin and ibuprofen. 
I'm fully aware of that most people on here are not doctors and so this is not a place for medical advice. I have consulted with my doctor, he does recommend the vaccine for me, but he suggested I get the Pfizer shot rather than the moderna because of the lower instance of myocarditis. 
I guess my question is, does anybody have any advice to not be freaking out or super nervous about getting my first dose? I've actually had nightmares about developing heart problems or difficulty breathing after the vaccine. Reoccurring nightmares for the past few months. It would not be an exaggeration to say that worries about the vaccine have been my major source of stress over the last 3 months, ever since I realized that would have to get it. 
Any advice, experiences, or tips would be very much appreciated.",2021-12-26,24,POST

I‚Äôm a 28 year old female, no co-morbidities, normal BMI. Exercise a few times a week, but have a sedentary job. My initial J+J back in April gave me some flu like symptoms that came on overnight and were gone by morning. I got my Pfizer booster in November as soon as I was eligible. No flu like symptoms, just a sore arm. Felt pretty much identical to the last time I had a tetanus shot.
Tested positive on Tuesday for Covid. This is my first time being infected. I‚Äôve two common colds already this fall and this was a breeeeeeze in comparison. Had a sore throat and slight fever over night, but have had just runny nose since. Temperature has been normal every day since. I really only had symptoms for a day and a half, even then they were only slightly uncomfortable. 
I have some friends who didn‚Äôt have the initial vaccine or weren‚Äôt boosted, who caught it over the last week and have been feeling pretty gnarly!! Body aches, fever, night sweats, cough, for days. This has made me feel pretty darn confident in the efficacy of these vaccines that I can catch a novel virus my body has never been exposed to before and remain pretty asymptomatic. I hope this helps quell the fears for some of you!!! I know it can all be a little scary!!

So she has gotten both Pfizer shots, with the last shot in July (so I admit it has been a while ago). No booster yet.   
About 2 weeks ago, she just woke up with a big bump on her lower arm, below the elbow. About the size of half an egg. It didn't hurt, although it was red. Suspecting a spider bite, she went to the Doctor. She got a course of antibiotics, but the bump didn't go down. She went back to the doctor. The doctor made an incision in an attempt to maybe drain it, but it didn't drain. 
It is just this rock hard bump on the back of her arm (kind of 1/4 down between the elbow and the wrist). Doctors are stumped. Sonar showed nothing. 
I figured I would just check to see if anyone else had similar symptoms. I asked her if she thought it was the vaccine, but she said ""definitely not"". But why else would you develop a random, gigantic, hard bump for no reason?

I mean uncontrollable itching that makes me cry in agony and the feeling of pins and needles on my cheeks and around my lips. There is nothing I can do to make it go away, according to my doctor. Zitrine aka Zyrtec is the ONLY thing that reduces these episodes, and if I'm late to take a pill by even 1 hour, I immediately am breaking out in hives again and develop a low fever. I'm taking ice cold showers to reduce the red swollen welts, during winter in the northeast. It's been absolute hell.

Me and my loved ones/friends are all vaccinated, all wear mask, and limit ourselves from doing stuff that risks spreading the virus. But that didn‚Äôt stop us from getting COVID, or from some being ill and going to the hospital. 
As time goes on, it does make you wonder if this is being overblown.

Last night (about 8 hours after shot) got the most intense headache of my life. Wanted to go to fridge to get myself a Gatorade but I literally couldn't move or the pain was too intense. Wanted to take a Tylenol but again, couldn't go get it. 
Then I started feeling really nauseous and just praying I wouldn't throw up. 
Lots of sweating and shivering through the night (didn't have thermometer). 
Managed to sleep at some point but then woke up again with headache - not as bad as last night but still really awful, so much that I still couldn't get my Gatorade etc. I really wanted crackers or an orange but couldn't make it happen. 
Eventually my mom came to check on me and gave me Gatorade, crackers, and Tylenol.

Boosted around 3pm yesterday afternoon. Thought I'd share an honest appraisal to you all:
12/22 3PM: Pfizer part III in the books.
12/22 6PM: A little advancing fatigue, arm slightly sore.
12/22 9PM: Significant fatigue, cognitively foggy, a bit achy but nothing major.
12/22 11PM: Continued substantial fatigue, feeling out of it, sort of like a malaise. Armpit mildly achy on shot side (left shoulder), likely lymph node swelling.
12/23 8AM: Wake up hot and uncomfortable. Headache. Severe fatigue. Body aching significant on left arm and near the armpit/lymph node. Mildly dizzy. Decide to stay in bed.
12/23 12PM. Wake up from ~12 hours of sleep, limited fragmentation of rest. Exhausted. Body still significantly achy, especially on shot arm/shoulder and armpit. Headache somewhat improved. Take temperature- 99.0, so no significant fever. Still somewhat foggy. Take 3x ibuprofen 200mg and eat some food.
12/23 2PM: Things start to improve. Post shower and meal, and perhaps owing to the ibuprofen, my headache vanishes. Fatigue improving, more energy in conversation. Achy sensations are now moderate, and armpit lymph node swelling had decreased by like 50%. Have some water and small coffee.
12/23 5PM: Substantial improvement, ~80% of my baseline. Body aches down to like 1/10. No headache or pain. Fogginess improving as well. Have dinner and appetite is back.
12/23 9PM: Back to about 90% of baseline, only mild fatigue left, rest of symptoms have remitted.

651,rngd3c,HIVES,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rngd3c/hives/,CovidVaccinated,"So I am writing this because I see I am not the only one with hives after the 3rd dose of Moderna. First dose went fine I was sick for a little and 48 hours later I was back to normal. Second dose I had a lot of trouble with. The first 24 hours were ok a sore arm and fatigue, then during the second day I felt like my torso was completely swollen, it was hard to breath then I began wheezing. I have a history of mild asthma. I was scared to sleep that night because I thought I was going to stop breathing. I did consider going to the ER.
November 17, 2021 I got my Booster. Exactly a week later I got the dreaded hives. I also have a history of eczema and sensitive skin. The hives woke me up that night, which was weird. It was all over. They appear like lines or ""scratches"" and even blotchy circles on my writes and feet. They would appear lifted and swollen, but most of all itchy as hell. They tend to spread if I itch them and can spread to a whole part of my body. My whole back was all hives a couple times. I also noticed that stress can also make the hives flare up more often! I did an experiment where I was in the shower and used a flosser to make a line on my shin and minutes later it was red, raised and itchy. I went to urgent care they put me on Prednisone for 6 days tampered off. The 6 & 5 day dose were amazing I hardly had any side effects, but as I slowly tapered off the hives came back full force. I am currently living off of tubes of Cortisone cream and Benadryl at night. Sometimes that doesn't even work and I wake up itchy for hours on end. I had an tele-visit with my dermatologist she said ""hives are hard to find the cause just take Allegra in the AM and Zyrtec in the PM"" she also suggested that I moisturize after showers. It helps a little, but ultimately I get the hives anyways. I am 24/7 uncomfortable. Its more annoying than anything. If I am lucky I will get a flare up and control myself not to itch it and it goes away eventually. Other times I give in and my whole body would flare up in hives for sometimes a couple hours.
Any advice on what to do next?? I have an appointment with an Allergist mid January just to cover all the bases. How are you guys dealing with it and keeping sane. These hives are slowly driving me bonkers!! Please tell me this isn't permanent. Might not get the 4th shot if there is one since it has only gotten progressively worse for me.",2021-12-24,4,POST
652,rnfm2r,"If the Pfizer vaccine has disrupted someone‚Äôs menstrual cycle due to hormonal changes, could it also interfere with the results of a pregnancy test?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rnfm2r/if_the_pfizer_vaccine_has_disrupted_someones/,CovidVaccinated,"Apologies for the lengthy post - you‚Äôll find a TL;DR at the bottom.
I just want to preface with the fact that my queries are strictly concerning immunological changes caused by the Pfizer vaccine and the potential relationship these may hold with altered menstrual hormone levels - but most importantly, I‚Äôm wondering if the latter could theoretically impact pregnancy test results. I‚Äôm not worried about infertility, or any other clinically disproven side effects. 
For context: a close friend had unprotected sex with her partner a few weeks back, and there was a little mishap when it came to ‚Äúpulling out‚Äù in time. She wasn‚Äôt on birth control, but took emergency contraception approximately 36 hours later. We have worked out that this incident most likely occurred just before, or on the day of, ovulation in her cycle. 
She received her second dosage of the Pfizer vaccine 10 days later. Her period - which is usually very regular - is slightly over 2 weeks late as of today. She was due to begin menstruating a few days after getting the jab. 
Here is where the confusion starts: in regards to what I can deduce from the body of research online, there‚Äôs a burgeoning medical recognition of the link between COVID-19 vaccinations, and disrupted menstrual cycles. However, there have not been any clinical studies conducted which investigate the correlation. The issue wasn‚Äôt documented during trial research, either. 
The consensus of medical professionals positing on the matter appears to be that the reaction is caused by changes in one‚Äôs immune system post-vaccination. These immunological factors subsequently trigger alterations in menstrual hormones and their production - a mechanism which can also occur from high stress levels. 
If this is the case, then is there a possibility that home pregnancy tests (which only screen for the hCG hormone), may be giving false negatives where they would typically be showing positive by now? Could hCG production be hampered by immunological byproducts from the vaccine, or would it not be affected in the same way that different menstrual hormones are? And lastly, is there a chance that these other hormones (which are potentially already impacted) could alter the amount of hCG levels to the point it would trigger a different result on a pregnancy test? 
She has spoken to a doctor via phone call, and was told that they are only conducting blood tests to screen for pregnancy 3 months after a missed period for vaccinated women. Another concern is that if the typical hormones triggered by pregnancy are stifled, then a lot of the normal symptoms won‚Äôt be present, either. 
Thank you so much to anybody who read this far. If there is any extra information I could provide that helps, please let me know. 
TL;DR: A growing sentiment within the medical field is that COVID-19 vaccinations are linked to disrupted menstruation cycles. Currently, there is an absence of clinical research, but conjecture from professionals suggests that this is due to changes in menstrual hormone levels, caused by immunological byproducts from the vaccine. Could a home pregnancy test result in a false negative, where it would otherwise show positive, because of the vaccination‚Äôs hormonal impact?",2021-12-24,3,POST

My first shot had no reaction whatsoever, no sore arm, no fevers etc. All good to go.
My second shot I had at 2:30pm, by late afternoon the injection site was sore to touch.
Around 7pm fever like chills began, lasting until 9pm and them back to normal.
Last urination before bed was clear, as per usual.
On waking the next morning, the first urination was claret red, and each urination after that.
All bloods and urine specs came back as good as it gets apart from Red Blood Cell (RBC) count. RBC of 617, with normal range being 1-10.
This high RBC lasted five full days, turned off as fast as it turned on, from one urination to the next.
Doctors response was less than satisfactory.
At 22yrs of age I had double pneumonia from Influenza-A that stopped me breathing for several minutes and I had to be revived. That was 25yrs ago now. Fit as a Malley bull then and still am.
The speed in which first symptoms appear to when breathing stops is quicker than one would imagine in some circumstances, so I'm all for mitigation measures.",2021-12-23,3,POST

I've been struggling with excessive hair shedding for almost 9 months now. I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine in late March this year, and noticed an increase in shedding a week or so after. By July, I was losing 300+ hairs a day.
I had everything I could possibly think of checked out. Hormone levels, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, ferritin, etc. Every lab was normal. I had two separate dermatologists confirm it was Telogen Effluvium. I racked my brain for anything that might have caused it.
No major stress, no family history, no changes in medication, no surgeries. Never had COVID as far as I know (got tested constantly). Prior to the shot, I hadn't even gotten sick or spiked a fever in over a year‚ÄìI actually felt more physically and mentally well than I had in a long time.
I used to have extremely thick, healthy hair and never struggled with shedding. After 9 months of losing clumps of it every day (especially in the shower, which I now dread), it is thin and lifeless. My part has widened significantly and it looks pathetic in a ponytail.
I obviously prefer this to getting and/or spreading COVID, however, I can't help but feel sad.
While it's regrettable that others are suffering, it helped to see others post about the same issue across Reddit and know that I'm not alone. 
Some people have stated that their doctors do think there is a potential link, but that doesn't do much in the name of statistical significance. The only scientific literature I could find on it is a report in the National Library of Medicine based on three cases of AA in Italy and a statement by a South Korean doctor quoted in a news article. Everything else is just personal accounts shared with the internet and maybe hairdressers.
I wanted to share my story and see if there are others who this might have happened to who haven't shared it yet.
I'm also concerned about getting the booster. While I've been shedding for a long time, it has finally slowed and I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm so worried that the booster will send me back into the shedding spiral. What should I do? Any advice?",2021-12-23,25,POST

I have a dilemma. I really, really want my kids (4 and 9) to see their Aunt, their Grandma, and Grandpa this Christmas a state away. Their Aunt is unvaccinated, as is her boyfriend, her 4 children, his 3 children, and any of their significant others, all of whom would certainly be coming over at some point.
Is it, less dangerous to send a kid to daycare or school every day for years with dozens or hundreds of children and adults of questionable vaccination and/or infection status? I feel like a huge hypocrite for considering staying home simply due to the fact that I know my sister's family's vaccination statuses. I don't know their classmates or teachers' statuses - yet they go, every... single... day, for hundreds of days, while I fret over 2 days with people I know absolutely are not vaccinated.
How do other parents deal with such dilemmas of hypocrisy? I feel like Spock would deem it illogical to withhold children from a group of families with a known set of risks, but happily tote them over to strangers of an unknown degree of risk on a daily basis throughout the entire year.

It is incredibly frustrating, because nothing I do to try to convince them otherwise has any impact.
But recently I've become aware that nearly all professional athletes in US pro sports like the NBA, NFL, and NHL have been vaccinated (something like 96-99% of the players have been vaccinated). That fact alone would be enough to convince me the vaccines are safe, because:
* Teams have BILLIONS of dollars tied up in player salaries, broadcast & marketing deals, merchandise, etc.
* Team doctors and training staff are typically the best doctors in the world, and those positions are VERY difficult to get.
If there was any truth to vaccines being dangerous, there's no way in hell these teams and players would get vaccinated with so much money on the line. The fact that team doctors, owners, and players have all moved forward with vaccinations tells me the vaccines are safe. What do you think?

First dose Pfizer: arm pain started 4 hours after injection, then slept for 14 hours. Arm pain persisted until the following day. 
Second dose Pfizer: arm tingled, then felt like I got birthday punches by a boxer. Exactly 12 hours post shot, had a fever of 101¬∞F and general feeling of icky. Couldn‚Äôt sleep because of the discomfort, so I loaded up with Tylenol PM and that did the trick. Following day only symptom was the dead arm. 
Moderna booster: the jab itself hurt more than the previous ones, but I‚Äôm convinced that‚Äôs due to getting it from a pharmacist as opposed to nurses (no offense to pharmacists at all, my moms a nurse so I‚Äôm biased, and they tend to know the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù where it won‚Äôt hurt as much).

I was going to go for Moderna this time. I know they're both very good, but from what I've read Moderna seems to have a slight edge, at least in the regular antibody levels.
However, that edge might be due to the fact Moderna is usually given in a larger dose. In my country, at least, the Moderna booster shot is ""only"" 25 mg/0.25 mL. The Pfizer booster shot, in the other hand, is the same as the first and second - 30 mg/0.3 mL.
With that in mind, should I still go for the Moderna booster, or would it be wiser to opt for a third Pfizer dose? I know the differences are likely slight, and I'll choose myself in the end, but thought Reddit might have some useful input.",2021-12-22,2,POST

Somedays it gets worse (like even when i sneeze, it hurts) and someday it gets better. 
All this happened while i was moving to another country so I was too busy to mind it. I eventually went to a physiotherapist a day before my flight and she said there is a spasm in my right arm. However, now in this new country, i can‚Äôt afford physiotherapy sessions.
Has this happened to anyone else? If yes, how did you resolved the pain?",2021-12-22,11,POST

Went to bed at about 8:30 pm, had a night of serious shivers and shakes. I was wrapped in blankets all night and it was a warm 24 deg C night. Temp of 39 deg c. Took panadole
Got up to have a shower in the morning, nearly threw up I was so light headed.
I sat in the shower for about 20 mins until I was able to get out and dry off then go back to bed. Temp of 38 deg c. Took panadole.
Spent most the day sleeping... back feels like someone worked me over with a baseball bat, 38 deg C Temp. Took panadole. 
So far pretty much the same experience as me 2nd pfizer shot, minus the thudding heart.
Should be over it and good to go in a couple of days. Just in time for Xmas.",2021-12-22,4,POST
716,rm01yi,Delayed onset of side effects from vaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rm01yi/delayed_onset_of_side_effects_from_vaccine/,CovidVaccinated,"
Hey all - using a throw away account since I don‚Äôt use Reddit much :) also reposting since I initially added this to the wrong subreddit.
I got 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and feel like my side effects were super uncommon so I wanted to see how other people were.
First Pfizer dose in April - side effects in first 24 hours: sore arm, nausea, diarrhea, chills. Cleared up by the next day. 
The week after my first dose I was super fatigued like I‚Äôve never been. Then maybe 2-3 weeks after my vaccine, I had the most awful vertigo I‚Äôve ever experienced. Doctors didn‚Äôt know what it was from, but afterwards we concluded it was because of the vaccine 
Second Pfizer does in May - side effects in first 48 hours: sore arm, worse nausea than first dose, bad headaches, aches, chills/intense shivers. 
Gradually these side effects cleared up over 3-4 days.
Needless to say I‚Äôm very nervous about getting the booster especially because it seems like so many people were fine after their first dose and I wasn‚Äôt. 
I was curious to hear if anyone else had delayed side effects or just generally how your experience was.
For reference I‚Äôm a 28 f (27 at the time of both doses), healthy, and underweight.",2021-12-22,1,POST

During her shot, the practitioner wrongfully injected it into her bloodstream, which I hypothesise might be the cause of this. Of course I am no medical expert, and this is a mere guess. After about a week of the vaccine, she began having constant pain and discomfort around the heart area. This would not end until about a month later, where it became occasional. This occasional pain is still continuing today. She did consult a doctor, and was told everything around her heart was normal.

I‚Äôm a 32 year old Male, in good shape, exercise regularly and eat pretty well. I‚Äôm basically terrified that my second mRNA shot is going to induce cardiac damage and ruin my life. It‚Äôs partially the health scare itself, and partially that I‚Äôm afraid I will become bitter and resentful towards my family who keep encouraging me to become fully vaccinated, should I end up having complications.
Given my demographic, would it be crazy to just go and get the normal J&J shot at this point? It seems like it has a lower risk of side effects for young men than either of the mRNA options. Would it be inadvisable to do this after having had a dose of Pfizer ~4 months ago?

I recently got my first phizer vaccine on the 9th Dec, i felt fine the following two days after, just had painful arm, couldn't lift it but nothing out of the ordinary. day 3 i had pins and needles across my entire arm and especially in my hand, thumb was the worse, when i moved my hand or arm id feel the sensation in other parts of my arm, kind of like the muscles in my arm were too small for the length of my arm (tugging sensation) it was so much worse at night and couldn't sleep for 3 nights. about 5 days in, i could feel the same sensation up my neck and back of head, including the sensation of someone putting pins in my head and a spider crawling across my face and neck. its been 12 days since the vaccine and i still have pins and needles in my finger tips but no where else. i briefly spoke to the doctor and she said it sounds like who ever gave me the vaccine did it wrong and hit a nerve. I'm extremely sceptical about getting my next which i need for a holiday, i was wondering if anyone has experienced the same or similar. i already have poor circulation, and usually have really cold hands and feet, and experience pins and needles quickly. i feel like everyone i tell is gas lighting me and saying its just anxiety etc., its extremely lonely and isolating. Just to add, i also have been having heart palpitations, however, i don't want to entirely say its the vaccine as I'm on medication for migraines that i haven't taken since the vaccine (i take propranolol often used for heart palps as well), and also have anxiety which causes them too.

I'm fully vaccinated and in my 20s, live alone, but work in the entertainment industry.   
As I was vaccinated in spring, I know the general recommendation is to get a booster.   
Thing is, when I got my second shot, the reaction was way worse than expected. I've never had a fever that high, and was up all night hallucinating. I thought I was in an episode of Bob's Burgers at one point, then began giving a power point presentation to my family that was not there using a computer that also wasn't there. I heard my heart beating out of my chest, and kept asking myself ""Should I call an ambulance?""   
Luckily, by the morning, it turned to just a normal fever and became bearable.   
Hearing that the booster is usually similar to the original dose, I want to avoid that experience at all cost. Reputable sources seem to be reporting that omicron symptoms are less intense then at least what I experienced with the vaccine, but I don't want to get anyone more vulnerable sick by being less protected.

43, hypothyroid (well, thyroid-less), obese but no other health concerns. 
My first shot resulted in a day of being super tired but no other side effects. Shot #2 kicked my butt. 12 hours post shot I felt like I had the first day of the flu and the two days that followed I felt like I had the tail end of a flu. My joints hurt, I had fever and chills and felt super exhausted.
That was back in April and I received my booster last Friday morning. I had zero side effects until midday Saturday when I realized my right underarm was sore and maybe a little swollen (same arm as the jab). Last night I had a low grade fever and was alternately felt too hot and freezing cold. I had weird dreams, woke up sweaty but feeling okay.
No other effects, my underarm continues to be slightly swollen/uncomfortable if I press it too hard but I reckon that will go away in a day or two. 
What I did differently from the second to the third:
On the advice of my doctor, I made sure I was well hydrated before the shot and grabbed a couple of Powerades and a body armor while I was out. When I came home I took a couple of baby aspirin (Friday morning), made sure to stay hydrated and alternated 4 baby aspirin or 1 ibuprofen starting about midday Saturday as soon as I felt the first signs of side effects.
I'm not sure if any of this has an impact but my booster felt much easier than my second shot for sure.

Received at 11:35am MST on 12.19
Around 9pm I had a bad headache, went to sleep

Managed to sleep on/off until about 7am 
Fever continued to climb to 102.8 - I was trembling due to feeling so cold but my thermometer said otherwise 
Fever was steady until 2pm and then it was like someone flipped the switch to 'off'. I was absolutely pouring sweat but my fever rapidly declined. 
4:37pm I no longer have a fever but I feel like I've run a marathon (heart is beating unreasonably fast going up and down the stairs) 
My primary concern is this... when I woke up at 4am, I noticed my hands/feet were very tingly. Like pins and needles. This has not dissipated yet (has been consistent all day). I have read that Guillian Barre Syndrom is a rare but documented side effect in the pfizer vaccine. That the pins and needles in the extremities is the first sign.

So when I got my first covid shot in May this year I felt ok for the first few hours, I had it done around 11am by 11pm I had a migraine, my arm was sore and that was it. I went to sleep after taking some paracetamol and woke up to every side effect in the book lol. It was short lived for a day & I felt fine after like nothing ever happened lol.
For my second shot I was okay, I felt the same side effects but this time a lot less intense, the chills were probably the worst thing and my arm was less sore this time even though it stung quite badly when it went in. Again, chills lasted a day and I was ok. 
Booster I had yesterday at 12pm I took a nap around 4pm idk if that was because of the booster or just because I hadn‚Äôt slept much the night before. It was a short nap but I felt fine after, only a sore arm but I kept moving it around so I don‚Äôt tense up, this morning I‚Äôve woken up completely fine just a sore arm.

Some background. The past two vaccines I‚Äôve gotten I‚Äôve had initial reactions of cold sweats and tunnel vision but ultimately only lasted 15 minutes and was fine. But these have made me hesitant to proceed with others. The second being last April when I got the first moderna dose. Over all had a couple days of being off and a general malaise with a bout of chills but that was it. I choose not to get the second out of worse side effects.  Have not gotten Covid still while living as normal as possible. Traveled to Vegas and Florida etc after. 
Anyway my employer didn‚Äôt mandate vaccines but  they‚Äôre asking for a negative test once a week beginning 1/4. I really do not want do this so decided to get the JNJ yesterday. (Irony of this is I wanted this one originally but the fda pulled it one day before choosing it back in April. Similar to this past week but given I‚Äôm a male I figured the risk of clots is very insignificant)
To prep I made sure to have Tylenol cold and flu severe on hand and a lot of pedalyite and Gatorade zero
Got the shot at about 1130 and could feel it a bit going in but otherwise not painful and I didn‚Äôt get the response I had previously which was really nice. I felt a little bit off for about 5 hours after but took the Tylenol and drank a ton of fluids. Slept fine and have not had any fevers or chills thus far. I exercised three days in a row so some of my soreness is definitely due to that. My arm is slightly sore today but no where near as bad as after the moderna. 
As someone who is certainly skeptical and hesitant I‚Äôm quite happy with my experience thus far and relieved in a way to not have to test 1x a week

Original post. I am an otherwise healthy young person.
Well, I expected things to get better after this post, but they got a little worse. I noticed on day 4 that I had a bunch of ""new freckles"" on my legs. I'm a really freckled person so I didn't notice it at first, but then I realized they were not freckles, they were tiny spots of bleeding under my skin.
I went to urgent care the next morning and the doctor there was intrigued by my mouth, legs, and general reaction. She sent me to the ER for emergency bloodwork due to the rash.
At the ER I learned I had lost half my platelets in the last few days, and had minor liver damage. They said it was a reaction to the vaccine, and I SHOULD be fine as long as a recheck of the blood tests in a week are improving. But also that I need to be vigilant of it getting worse.
So now I'm in a bit of a limbo where I'm sitting around waiting for something else to start bleeding so I know I need to go to the ER again before I have a stroke. 
Fingers crossed that the platelets are improving instead!
I am never allowed to get any covid vaccine again. This is the first time I've ever had this kind of reaction to anything.
I'm a little relieved because the second and third shots were hell, but I'm also worried about getting covid in the future now.
They didn't explain to me exactly how rare this is, but from what I understand, this is extremely unusual and should not scare anyone else away from their doses.",2021-12-19,247,POST

I am well rested, alert, and I did have some sinus/tinnitus flare up yesterday but it seems to not be worsening. 
Overall, Pfizer was symptomatically about the same as my moderna 2nd shot, although I did not have any body aches or chills this time. I was still pretty much out of commission for 3/4 of yesterday. Headache wasn‚Äôt as bad as 2nd shot, but I did have to take ibuprofen for it. By around 5pm yesterday, I was feeling improvements already. 
It‚Äôs now about 6 hours after my booster.
I have health anxiety and I was really dreading this day but the fucking CDC is recommending it so I did it.
First shot of moderna: just a sore arm
Second shot of moderna: sore arm and then intense fatigue and body aches for 24 hours, developed a headache within the last day of symptoms as well, fully recovered within 48 hours, no other symptoms after that
Pfizer booster, 6 hours out: sore arm. I am starting to notice mild pins and needle sensations in my back, but it is barely noticeable but I‚Äôm concerned this could be a sign of GBS. I‚Äôve gotten random pins and needles sensations before if a room is too cold. But I don‚Äôt feel hot/cold, nor do I have a fever. I‚Äôll update tomorrow on how I feel.
For the record, I have no known health conditions and have never reacted too badly to shots. I was exposed by my husband when he got Covid back in July (he was a breakthrough case) but I never developed symptoms or tested positive.
UPDATE 2: 8 hours after. I had a pretty rough night. Compared to my 2nd dose, I am not sensing any intense muscle ache or fatigue. I did/do have a slight headache.
However, it took my a good 2 hours to fall asleep because of tinnitus. I started noticing a higher pitched ringing in my right about 3 hours after the shot. I tried not to panic. Then I noticed again when I tried to fall asleep on my right side. I started crying because I have generalized anxiety disorder focused on health and I‚Äôm just terrified that I‚Äôm going to have a long term side effect to the booster. I won‚Äôt be taking any more vaccines until the side effects are absolutely minimal. 
Let me be forthcoming and say that I don‚Äôt think the vaccine CAUSES tinnitus. I think it just triggered a flare up from the anxiety/actual inflammation from the side effects. I actually have a recent memory of noticing it before falling asleep and then quickly forgetting it within the past 2 weeks. If I do notice tinnitus, it‚Äôs generally after concerts or having a bad cold. I am praying it‚Äôs just related to my allergies. I live in TX and cedar fever has just started.

I know that in the early days of the pandemic, doctors and scientists thought that the virus spread through fomites and were unsure about whether or not it spread through food. That suggests to me that in principle, coronavirus is can sometimes spread that way, even if the original COVID-19 coronavirus did not.
So, when the virus mutates, is it reasonable to suppose that it might have found ways to transmit through fomites or food? Or, more happily, is there some reason to think that the particular nature of the COVID-19 coronavirus means that this won't happen even after a significant mutation?

It started out with low heart rate, low blood pressure, and mild chest tightness. A week later, my stomach became extremely bloated and my IBS-C is in the worst condition it's ever been in my life. Just a few days ago, I started feeling mild dizziness, akin to vertigo, all day long. Now I'm experiencing all these issues at once.
I'm 27, otherwise previously healthy, and I've been in and out of the ER and doctors' offices because of this for about a month and half now. No tests seem to be giving any results. Complete blood work, down to checking BNP and troponin. Chest x-ray, and even a CT scan on my abdomen for the bloating.
I don't want to conclusively say the vaccine did all of this to me, but, in retrospect, nothing in my lifestyle had shifted around that time, except for getting the second dose.
Right now, I'm in such immense discomfort, mostly from the bloating, that my life is basically on hold. My doctors won't even entertain the idea that it's vaccine related. I bring it up, and immediately get shut down.

I got my first pfizer shot in Early May and as soon as the nurse pulled the syringe out, I was bleeding - she needed to use a tissue with pressure, then later after I removed the bandaid, the pad was saturated with dried blood. Very shortly after the injection, I had a funny taste in my mouth (nerves, I thought) then in the 15 minute waiting period I got extremely nauseous, and my heart was racing to over 130bpm, as my watch alerted me about high bpm. I brushed it off, didn't tell staff there and went on my way home.
That night was probably the worst headache I've ever experienced, elevated temp, and an on/off racing of my heart along with palpitations in the evening. After a few days this cleared up, but the palpitations stuck around. I've never had palpitations before, and as time went on, they became less frequent, and they still occasionally happen.
My PCP chaulked it up to anxiety and slightly higher than normal caffeine usage. I insisted that was not the case, I have never been an anxious person, and reduced my caffeine intake to satisfy my PCP. I kept bugging him about the troubles, and now my concern about getting the second dose, and he gave me an EKG and a verbal consult with a cardiologist. The Cardiologist says, yes, very likely myocarditis, or maybe pericarditis as we have somewhat seen in rare cases, but since it has been so long, and I don't experience any further symptoms it's unlikely there is any long-lasting damage and should be ok. Then my PCP advised me to get the second dose if I wanted and to 'just go to the ER if I feel unwell about it afterward.' Great - that's very reassuring. I get we're all in fairly uncharted territory here, but I find that a bit unsettling.
Can anyone, or has anyone that experienced something similar, share with me any sort of story, paper, or otherwise on the outcome of a second dose / booster after a diagnosed case of myocarditis? I have asked some Doctors, none know what to say. I have called around to make an appointment, but when I do so, I've asked if they will aspirate the syringe, and I have actually had some people laugh at me for that, and no one will. Some even have said, 'they don't train us to do that."" I suppose this experience has caused me to develop some anxiety, as my gut tells me to not get the second dose because that was clearly a very negative physiological experience.  But I do want to get it to protect myself, and my family.
I don't write and ask of this to discourage anyone from getting vaccinated, understand that I am just a small unlucky percentage, and am looking for more information regarding my situation. And yes, I'm looking for a new PCP who can at least display some sympathy.
TL;DR - diagnosed with myocarditis after first pfizer dose. Dr tells me to get a second shot if I want and to just go to the ER if I feel unwell. I'm looking for experiences, case studies, or papers of others' experiences after being diagnosed with myocarditis due to vaccination, then receiving their second / booster shot.",2021-12-18,38,POST
822,riytbl,"Johnson and Johnson Vaccine experience while diagnosed with CRPS/ RSD, Fibromyalgia",https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/riytbl/johnson_and_johnson_vaccine_experience_while/,CovidVaccinated," 
Long post so bear with me if you read this. Also, Please be kind in your responses. There are a lot of folx like me who want to to the right thing and get vaccinated but have serious health concerns that are not reflected, addressed or well researched when vaccines etc are created and tested for safety and our primary care doctors and even specialists don't have answers for us so we are often forced to decide blindly on whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks. Simply put, Chronic pain sufferer's and other invisible health conditions and disabilities have not been factored into how the medical field has addressed Covid and it's made it a nightmare for those of us with those conditions to figure out what is best for us and our loved ones.
I am sharing this here because there is next to no data on how these vaccines affect folks who suffer from chronic pain and it was extremely difficult to figure out if the vaccine was safe for me. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to get answers from doctors, nurses, medical studies and when no one seemed to have answers, turned to the internet, which didn't provide much either. Hopefully this will provide at least some anecdotal evidence for someone else who may be weighing seriously the benefits versus the risk while suffering from chronic pain and an overreactive central nervous system.
For those google searching to find out if vaccines are safe with specific conditions I got the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine and I am diagnosed with CRPS/ RSD, Fibromyalgia and C-PTSD. I am biologically female, and just shy of 30 years old. I don't take prescription medications anymore ( they made everything so much worse) and largely manage my pain with exercise, Doans, a heating pad and topical pain creams. I rarely have severe pain flares anymore as long as I stick to what works and don't push myself too hard.
I decided on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in spite of the slight risk of developing blood clots and Guillain-Barre syndrome because the side effects of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine barring those two conditions or an allergic reaction, are said to be considerably milder than the PFizer and Moderna Vaccines. That and only requiring one shot as opposed to two would theoretically decrease the time needed to recover. I have worked very hard to get my symptoms and pain levels to a manageable place and am very careful to not do anything I know will trigger a pain flare as they can last weeks once triggered. I work full time and am not on disability so I dont have a safety net when my pain flares, I have to work to avoid flareups because it becomes extremely costly if a flareup happens.
Since I have contracted Covid twice, once before it was known to be in the US, and the second time the morning I was originally set to be vaccinated back in august, I figured the Johnson and Johnson should be sufficient to boost my immunity and hopefully mild enough to not trigger a major pain flare as I have not had one since my last brush with covid back in August.
I received my shot last friday, exactly one week ago in my left arm at 4:30 pm. I was also on my cycle when I recieved the vaccine. My CRPS originates in my left leg and can flare predominately on my left side of my body, but it is also unpredictable and can flare in the right side of my body instead. I was nervous and wanted the shot over with and didn't think through the consequences of choosing the left side. I remained on site for an hour after the vaccine just to be safe and did not have an allergic reaction.
Progression of side effects:
Within an hour, my shoulder was already pretty sore and I was getting light headed. By four hours in, my left shoulder and up the left side of my neck was hurting and the migraine was starting.
Interestingly, I've noticed that several folx have described the vaccine interrupting their cycles. That was my experience too. I was having a SEVERE period prior to the vaccine. By the time I went to bed Friday night, my cycle had gone from one of the heaviest and most painful I've had to stopping completely. however, by the time I went to bed around 11pm, My body had switched from severe period pain to severe pain flare. my whole back was beginning to flare. I woke to tornado sirens around 3 am and was having considerable muscle aches and pains as well as chills from head to toe. I was also beginning to experience muscle cramps in my legs. I opted not to get out of bed after the first tornado siren, I was in too much pain to stay in the cramped bathroom. Fortunately, no tornados landed in my county and my home was untouched.
I spent the entirety of Saturday in bed on my heating pad with a severe migraine and full body muscle aches. I was very fatigued and lightheaded. It hurt to lift or move the shoulder where the shot was administered.
Sunday I was able to make it to my couch but remained mostly immobile due to muscle aches, the migraine and fatigue. light and noise hurt so i stayed completely immobile and in the dark.
Monday- I worked from home and I dealt mostly with muscle aches, and the soreness in my left shoulder and fatigue. Weirdly, The soreness in my arm was getting worse instead of better, bruising beginning to appear where the shot was administered. The migraine was coming and going at this point and there was definitely tension developing in my shoulder and neck. I started developing pain and nausea in my stomach, not period cramps, just pain.
Tuesday- I actually started feeling a bit better aside from the soreness and stiffness in my arm and creeping up my neck and I was able to work from home again, laying on my heating pad during breaks. Nausea came and went as well as pain in my stomach.
Wednesday- I woke up to my left shoulder, neck and head screaming in pain. I spent the day in bed with another crippling migraine and severe back pain and intermittent leg cramps. the nausea was particularly bad and my stomach seemed to be bloating as well.
Thursday and Today- the soreness in my arm is FINALLY subsiding. I am still dealing with severe back pain originating on the left side and spreading from there. The fatigue is finally improving, although I have intermittently dealt with chest tightness without cause the last two days. It seems to flare alongside the back spasms and pain. There has been less bloating and nausea the last two days.
So how do I feel about the vaccine versus the virus? Honestly? the progression of the side effects was EXACTLY the same as the progression of the virus during the first 48 hours with a few exceptions:
* I had the worst sore throat of my life when I caught the Delta Variant. My throat and mouth were covered in sores that took a full month to heal after being asymptomatic. I never developed a sore throat or cough from the vaccine. If the Johnson and Johnson keeps me from having to deal with that again it may well be worth the pain flare I'm still dealing with.
* The muscle aches/pain and migraine are lasting longer with the vaccine than with Covid. The severity of the pain is the same, the duration of the pain flare triggered by the vaccine has far exceeded the actual virus though. I had severe muscle aches/ pain and cramps during the first 24 hours of the Delta variant, with the vaccine its been nearly constant for a week.
* Sleep- when I had the delta variant, I spent the better part of a week asleep. After the vaccine, I've dealt with a resurgence of insomnia. It may be partly due to being in a pretty significant pain flare, but it also seems to be present when I'm feeling a bit better. Its taking longer to fall asleep and I'm waking up frequently at night, something I had largely gotten under control prior to the vaccine.
To Date, I have not dealt with any of what I would consider severe or alarming side effects and I am keeping a close eye on my health and symptoms to hopefully catch any serious issues as early as possible. The only part that is somewhat concerning is that the side effects are lasting far longer than forecast by experts.
My experience with the shot has more than validated my hesitancy with getting it in the first place and I have decided that I will not be getting vaccinated again unless/until there is a vaccine with proven potency that lasts longer than 3-6 months. It's a LOT to ask someone with an extremely over reactive central nervous system to willingly do something that will trigger a flare up. I am relieved that I chose the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as opposed to one of the more potent and side effect laden vaccines, even as I am frustrated with all the new data that came out on the J &J risks that came out hours after I was given the shot. I chose J &J after seeing many of my fellow chronic pain suffering friends and loved ones choose Moderna or Pfizer and struggle to recover their energy levels.
I'll close with this... The jury is still out for me on whether or not the J & J was worth it to me. I'm still paying for it. That said... I wouldn't dream of telling someone if they should get the shot or not if they have chronic pain or which one they should get. Unfortunately, there simply isn't a lot of data one way or another to tell someone who suffers from chronic pain whether or not its truly safe to take and even doctors and other medical experts don't seem to have those answers. I simply hope that my experience will provide someone else some context and some anecdotal information that they can use to make the best decision they can for themselves in the absence of reliable data.",2021-12-18,9,POST

I originally got the J&J in April‚Ä¶ like two days before the blood clot news hit. So I spent 3 weeks in an absolute panic attack and had a health anxiety relapse that to this day hasn‚Äôt subsided very much. So needless to say, when boosters started being discussed, I held out hope that mixing vaccines would be approved. So when it was, I was so psyched to get Moderna instead of J&J. Buuuuuut then I remembered the myocardium issues and now I‚Äôm scared that I made a bad choice. 
So far (only 4 hours out) my arm hurts, I have a slight headache, my shoulder muscles are tense (also happened after J&J, chalked that up to anxiety tension) and my body can‚Äôt decide if it wants to be hot or cold. I‚Äôll update this post in the morning and see if more side effects appear or disappear.
EDIT: it‚Äôs been 17 hours since my shot. I‚Äôm definitely tired and my arm is sore but other than that, feeling totally fine! So far this arm pain is nothing compared to the pain I had from the J&J shot. I also got this one in my dominant arm so that might have something to do with the decreased pain. Hoping this arm pain tapers off faster too. I had arm pain from J&J for over a week.
EDIT 2: it‚Äôs been 24 hours and aside from my sore arm, some slight dizziness, and slight nausea, I feel totally fine still! If my arm didn‚Äôt hurt, I wouldn‚Äôt even know that I got the shot lol
EDIT 3: it‚Äôs been about 48 hours now and I‚Äôm still feeling okay. Woke up with a sore throat but it feels like post nasal drip more than anything. Arm is definitely feeling better. I did have a wicked dizzy spell last night where I almost fell over but it passed and hasn‚Äôt happened again.

I've heard the immune response is quicker/stronger if you've already had covid. I got really sick back in August- was in bed for 2 weeks and still felt bad for weeks after that, luckily no hospital needed. I lost my smell too so it's safe to assume it was covid.
I got Moderna a few days ago. I also got a flu shot at the same time. I got it around 1pm and felt symptoms by nighttime. I had a headache and was very tired; slept like a baby but couldn't sleep on the Moderna arm... The next day was the same, headache and fatigue. I'm not working at the moment but if I was, I would've taken the day off. 
I treated it like a cold, eating healthily and staying hydrated helped. I was on my feet most of the day which may have helped as well. The Moderna arm was much more sore than the flu shot arm for sure!! All symptoms and soreness were gone within about 48 hours.

We have been super cautious throughout the  pandemic, getting vaccinated as soon as we were able and not taking our  under 5 kids anywhere. About a month ago my husband got a bad cold, he  got tested twice with PCR test and it was always negative. Kids got sick  too and I used the Binax now test for them while they were symptomatic,  all negative.
After my husband  recovered he said he still felt like crap, exhausted, and he said he  felt like his symptoms echoed all of those his post-infectious covid  patients complained of (fatigue, body aches, etc. etc.). We are both  boosted with the Moderna shot, mine about 3-4 weeks ago. He said he  would get an antibody test but my schedule is more flexible so I went  ahead and got one done yesterday figuring that if he got covid I've  probably had it by now too. The test is the Roche Elecsys  Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test, and the results positive, above the max possible  result (so > 2500.0 [u/ml](https://www.reddit.com/u/ml/)).
The  thing is, the CDC website says that only some antibody tests are able  to distinguish between post-infectious antibodies and post-vaccine  antibodies, but I'm not seeing anywhere online whether the Roche test  can make this distinction. I do see this test being used to detect post-vaccine antibodies, so I'm assuming this test is not able to make the distinction. I guess my only option is to have my oldest child tested for antibodies. She can't get the vaccine yet and it would make a  difference in our lives if we knew that our kids have already had  covid.
Can anyone provide insight  as to whether my results merely reflect my body's response to the  booster, or whether I've had an infection? Thank you!

To get straight to the point, I have a quick question regarding my antibody levels. 
My age is 28 ( male, healthy, athlete, no meds ) and yesterday had a IgG antibody test just to see what's the situation on my body. ( of course it can't be the only indicator cause as we know other cells play a role, genetic factors or many other factors as well ). 
The number I had from this test  was **1296.60 au/ml** ( I don't know the specific laboratory procedure they performed in my test, not sure if that plays a role ) and that was exactly **140** days **AFTER** the second dose ( Pfizer for both shots ). I certainly had immediate or indirect contact with covid patients ( I was working in a hospital but never got ill with symptoms since the pandemic started ) and also with crowds of people in town e.g. transporting etc. 
My question is what does this number mean? Considering my age, the vaccination or other factors. Is it representative or good result? And also about the booster I'll need to do in the near future, is it more effective to extend the period of the 3rd dose instead of 5 months to 6-7 months for example?

Has anyone else experienced heart palpitations after recieving their shot(s) or boosters? And do you have any advice to help alleviate the symptoms? I'm trying to figure out if I should be freaking out and going to the E.R. 
I'm a woman in my early 20s. I weigh 110lbs, exercise regularly, and I have no pre-existing heart conditions. I had no issues with my first 2 doses besides a mild headache and arm pain with each. 
I just got my pfizer booster this Tuesday. I felt completely fine afterwards, but then sometime in the night I stated experiencing a racing heart just sitting on my couch doing nothing. It felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest.
I thought it was weird but didn't think much of it and went to bed. When I woke up sometime in the middle of the night and walked to the bathroom, I had to grab onto the wall before I hit the ground. My heart sped up like I was being chased and I saw black spots in my vision. I crawled back into bed and was unable to sleep. 
I've been on bed rest since then and have had my heart race while sitting down doing nothing. It's very sporadic. Of the few times I've had to get up, if I move any faster than a snail's pace I feel like I'm going to hit the ground. I also had a moment where I believe my heart beat arrhythmically, but only for a second and it hasn't happened since. My mom also got her shot at the same time and hasn't experienced any issues like mine. 
What would you do if you were me? And has anyone had this happen? Will this subside soon or should I go ahead and get check out? I'm already planning on calling my pcp tomorrow and scheduling an appointment just in case. However my heart problems are so sporadic and unpredictable that I doubt anything will turn up.",2021-12-17,7,POST
859,ria95o,Is it possible to just get a booster?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/ria95o/is_it_possible_to_just_get_a_booster/,CovidVaccinated,"I know not of science... But I'll still share my confusion.
I've seen reports about major increase in virus prevention from boosters.
I've also seen DiBlasio of NYC (granted he's a goon) say that people should get a booster.. likely because of the waning effects of the original shot.
Then i see that the original shots arent effective against omicron but the boosters are immensely effective.
1) So this is where my science fails me but.. if vaccinated people lost immunity (if they received prior to June) and the unvaxxed have none of the jab in their systems.. why couldn't everyone just start from square one at the booster level. You could probably convince people if they see that an effective, non JnJ option is available in single dose form. Why have the unvaxxed start from square one?
2) If there was 100% vaccination rate (pre omicron and delta) - would someone who got COVID still quarantine if they are asymptomatic? That question comes from the fact that it seems like companies asking people to return to the office are very unclear about what they need to worry about. In the last few months there's been unspoken hints of wanting people back and of course some did to see their friends or get free lunch or whatever small company perks are. But i figured those people, even vaxxed, could be giving each other COVID.. no i never believed the vax made you bullet proof. Thoughts?
3) sorry this is super long thus far. One more dumb question.. would the vax rates be super high if they didn't wave liability for big pharma in the states?

Felt nauseous in the morning, but decided to work. A few hrs in, while in front of the PC, I felt a warm ""gushy"" sensation and heard drip sounds. Looked down and blood was pouring out of my nose onto my keyboard and work desk... Very very messy. Bleeding stopped but came back twice later in the day, all from the same nostril.
I now have a golfball size lymphnode under my left arm (injection site), muscle aches, dizziness and an elevated heart rate. Dont know how to measure it, but I can feel it racing.
Reached out to my doc. He said the bleeding was likely ""allergies"" or dry air. For the record, I haven't had a nosebleed in at least 10 years..but who knows.
I feel like a beaten dog. Had none of these issues with the first two jabs, besides a bit of muscle aches.",2021-12-16,134,POST

Any reason for concern or am I overthinking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rhi481/strange_booster_injection_experience_any_reason/,CovidVaccinated,"While I was grocery shopping tonight at a store that I rarely visit, I decided to ask their pharmacist if they had any upcoming appointments for a booster shot, since my typical sources (cvs, walgreens, clinic) have been booked out a few weeks. The phramacist offered to give me the booster right then, even though if was 5 minutes to close and they typically require appointments. Eagar to be boosted, I took the opportunity. 
As they prepped my info, I noticed that this pharmacist appeared to be pretty scattered - talking out loud multiple times about mistakes they were making on the computer and filling out paperwork. I figured it was the end of the night so they were maybe a bit rushed - understandable. 
As I was getting injected, the pharmacist said they were about to throw the vaccine they were injecting away so it was funny to them that I walked up and asked for it. I assume it was going to be thrown away because if was the end of the night, but not knowing anything about vaccine shelf life or storage, if was a bit strange to hear. 
Upon injection, the pharmacist appeared to be shocked and said that I was bleeding a lot (I do not typically bleed with injections). She didn‚Äôt have any material with her to hold to the bleeding injection site, so she held her rubber glove to it while saying ‚Äòwhat the heck, why are you bleeding so much?‚Äô After a few minutes of the rubber glove not working well to clean or control the bleeding, she ran and got a rag or something to help. 
I also now notice that the injection site it much higher on my arm than my previous ones were - only about an inch or two from the top of my shoulder. 
While I trust her crendentials and know everything is probably fine, I‚Äôm feeling a bit uneasy about the experience.

I was able to get the first two doses pretty early-1/20/21 for the first and 2/17/21 for the second. Clinic had extra doses, and my doc signed me up due to my history of respiratory issues. Received my Booster on November 1st. All 3 shots were Moderna. I was originally gonna just talk about my Booster, but I figured I'll include the first 2 as well. Here's my experience with all 3:  
1st: 1/20- Had a bit of metallic taste in my mouth and a runny nose within a few minutes of receiving the shot, at about 11am in the morning. Sore arm kicked in after a few hours, and by 5pm I was feeling very exhausted. Had eaten dinner at the parents' house, and just driving the 6 blocks back to my place felt like an utter chore. Started running a fever at some point that night- I didn't have a thermometer handy, but I was shivering and had to wrap up in blankets by the time I went to bed. The next day I was mostly feeling better, but was still very tired and my arm was nigh unusable. Work was a pain that day. But, by the day after that, I had my energy back and my arm slowly got better over the next couple days.  
2nd: 2/17- Was pretty nervous about the second dose, as I was told it's usually far worse in terms of side effects, so I requested the next day off work and prepared myself for the worst. Got the same metallic taste and runny nose a few minutes after the shot, and the tiredness started to kick in after a couple hours, followed by the sore arm at evening. But, to my surprise, that's about all it was. I was almost completely better by the next day, so I basically got a free day off. Much less side effects than the first dose. Was told by my doc later on that having stronger effects from the 1st dose could mean I had the virus already and didn't know it, so if that was the case, maybe I got lucky.  
Booster: 11-1- Same metallic taste and runny nose almost right after the shot. The main side effect this time was just the sheer tiredness. Later that day and all through the next day, I basically had no energy whatsoever. Started getting better by Day 3, but was still dragging a bit for a couple more days. Sore arm was also back, though not as bad as the first two times. Lol, my neighbor, an older woman, told me that I was getting a taste of what it's like to be old, so at least I got a laugh out of it.  
All in all, for me, the 1st shot was the worst, and the 2nd shot was the easiest.  
Booster was in the middle-had the longest lasting effects, but that was mainly just tiredness.

I was delaying getting vaccinated until more information was available for autoimmune conditions. On CDCs website at the time it stated ‚ÄúPeople with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently
available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions.‚Äù 
I was going to delay longer but it became a requirement for work and autoimmune conditions did not qualify for medical exemptions. I spoke to all of my doctors and they were okay with me receiving the vaccine. 
September 9th 2021: I received my first dose for Moderna. I was a little dizzy afterwards but nothing too scary. I had the normal sore arm but no other symptoms. About a week later I developed hives. They were not itchy and localized to my lower body. I initially thought it was unrelated to the shot due to the delayed response. Before my second dose I mentioned this to the pharmacist. He thought it was just another normal reaction to the shot and was okay with me getting the second. 
October 7th 2021: this is when everything went downhill. I received my second dose. Right after it I had the similar dizziness as the first dose, nothing too crazy. I went back to work and about 45 minutes later I had chest tightness and shortness of breath. I took some Tylenol and left. I was going to go to the emergency department but the symptoms went away shortly, so I went home. During dinner I started to have a headache and the dizziness came back. I went home took some Benadryl and went to bed
October 8th: I woke up with a temperature of 103 F, body aches, a headache, and hives all over my body. I called into work and stayed home. That day I had extreme fatigue and could barely sit up off the couch. I spent the entire day feeling crappy. I took Benadryl, Tylenol, and NyQuil.
The next day and every day since then I have had a headache, nausea, or dizziness. The hives eventually went away but lasted for several weeks. Occasional chest tightness that usually doesn‚Äôt last long and is only a day every now and then, it seemed more musculoskeletal, discomfort with position changes. I used the EKG app on my watch and everything seemed fine. 
When my mom received her doses her symptoms lasted about 2 weeks. I waited two weeks to see if they would stop and made an appointment with my PCP. He initially thought it was a side effect of a medication that I was taking so we tried stopping it to see if it helped.  We ruled out pregnancy. 2 weeks later I was still having symptoms so I contacted my provider again. 
He thought that it was some form of a migraine and prescribed me some medication for the headaches, but the never went away. On Thanksgiving I was just sitting there and my watch alarmed for higher heart rate 120 for greater than 10 minutes without activity. I felt fine at the time. About a week later I started having the chest tightness again. According to my watch my average resting heart rate was trending up. I noticed that I could be doing nothing and it would be anywhere from 100-120. 
I followed up with my provider again. EKG, chest X-ray, and lab work all came back fine, just sinus tachycardia. Plan to follow up with cardiology.   
It‚Äôs been 10 weeks and I am still having symptoms. Some days are not as severe, but I still have mild symptoms. 
Has anyone else experienced this?
Edit: 12/23 update. I went to a cardiologist this week. Blood work and EKG came back fine. Plan to have an ECHO and stress test in the coming weeks. I noticed last night that some small hives have started to reappear.",2021-12-16,5,POST

I've posted about this. 22m. Had COVID early on when it was starting - was pretty much asymptomatic so was my Mom. I was around a ton of people who had COVID and never caught it after my prior infection. Vaccines came out and I was like Eh I'll go ahead and get it. I did and 3 days later I was in hospital with Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia & Supra-Venticular Tachycardia. Released after a day and a half and was told I'm fine.
Been going back and forth if I can should get boostered. Docs said I could but doesn't really matter since I'm young, healthy, my prior reaction, and my prior infection.
Figured I'd go ahead and do it since I'll be traveling a lot come spring and summer time so I got the Pfizer booster today. My legs became sore like 2 hours after getting the booster but so far so good - they aren't sore anymore

So, we had our boosters at ~ 12:55pm. He (my partner) had his in his left arm, I had mine in my right.  
I must admit that I had a bit of a derp in my thought process when I was still working and had my Pfizer, as I was also taught to balance 3 plates over two hands (1 in the right hand, two in my left) during my initial vocational training a couple of years back. However I noticed no discomfort when doing this task - perhaps I wasn't so focused on the pain then and have more muscle mass? Also as I don't waitress anymore (where I learnt to wait with a tray in my left hand), I still chose to get it in my right arm as that is my go to arm, despite being right handed. Derp. 
So cut to ~half 6. I'm exhausted more than normal. So I end up sleeping on the couch until gone 11. By this time I have a sore arm and a stabbing headache. I struggle to get ready for bed, so I have to get my partner to assist me. 
This morning I was struggling to move for muscle ache. I've spent most of the day resting, my appetite has been a bit rubbish, and I've been trying to drink as much fluid as possible. 
I'm hoping it will pass soon as I don't like the lethargy, I need to prep for Christmas at home before the hamstering begins in the supermarkets and I hate being this inactive/helpless, especially with my mental health, which unrelated to the booster is a factor in my general wellbeing. If I'm better tomorrow, I will attempt to walk to the local market, but if I can't, I can't. I'm glad I've got this done, because COVID is frightening.",2021-12-16,4,POST

I got my 1st dose (yes I delayed) a month ago. My arm ached for about 20 minutes after and then that was it. I felt pretty normal.

I did notice a pressure at the bridge of my nose, like it was being squeezed but went to bed fine and woke up fine the next day.
I continued to get super mild headaches for three weeks, mainly the evening, every day with the occasional feeling of pressure in my nose like it's swollen or being squeezed. I don't have a blocked nose, there's no new mucus, it's literally just that feeling.
After three weeks I got a few days without a headache and thought it was done with, now at 4 weeks post vaccination they're back again. I've had to take painkillers maybe three times and they weren't severe, just moderate and bothering me. The pressure feels stronger than it did before.
I contacted the Dr who thinks it's something else despite happening the next day and that I don't really ever suffer from headaches. He's suggested basically a sinus infection despite there being no mucus and I can breathe easily, this consultation was done online though, not in person.

Drs were not interested in the reaction and said I should still get the booster, so I did, Monday afternoon. I felt terrible again, but this time only for about 24h.
As if feeling better is a trigger, now the blisters are here again, and there's even more this time.

This is the beginning stage- they will grow 4x the size and start hurting soon.
I was holding out hope that I wouldn't get them this time, I was taking Zirtec as recommended by my PCP, so I am really bummed about it. I hate that I have to look forward to a week of ridiculous agony whenever I get a booster. Advil, Tylenol, Zirtec, Benedryl+Maalox- nothing helps.
I hope they only last a short time, similar to how my side effects were less this time, but I'm not holding out hope.
I'm hoping when I am up for a booster in the future, there may be other types that will not result in this.

I‚Äôve never had sleep problems, I used to fall asleep within minutes of laying down and watching random shit on my phone. Now when I lay down I feel so alert and focused. It seems like I can only instantly fall asleep if I‚Äôm drunk.
Most of the nights I get around 5 hours of sleep and feel tired in the morning but tonight I‚Äôve managed to sleep for a grand total of 1 hour. Meanwhile I haven‚Äôt had any lifestyle changes in between, I go to work, eat healthy, dont drink caffeine, go to the gym, hang around with my gf, go out on the weekends, maybe play games a couple of hours a week.
Also before it slips my mind, my back still hurts a bit at the same place where it was sore and it‚Äôs noticeable only if I arch it while laying, I regularly go to the gym and I‚Äôve never had a muscle that sore.
Anyone else having similar side effects, does it get better? I am not even sure if this is a side effect or just a coincidence.",2021-12-15,15,POST

We're thinking of getting the booster, and I'm wondering if she's as risk of a blood clot.
Edit: She's has a lot of anxiety, and because it only happened with her first shot, and the blurry vision only lasted a hour after the shot, shes not at risk for a blood clot, just nerve and low blood pressure. Ty a ton. From what the dr. Said, blood clots happen 5-10 days after the shot, not immediately. A booster is recommended so she doesn't have a adverse effect to getting covid.",2021-12-15,25,POST

So, since people are now getting boosters and some people are really scared for chest pain, cardiac issues I have a solution that might help your Chest pain or even prevent it from happening in the first insistence.
Background, I got a Pfizer shot and the first dose gave me chest pain for like 1 week straight, I couldn't sleep on my side. I then took ""Magnesium Taurate"" this one specifically helps the heart and overall cardiac health it helped me really quick. So then, I spaced out my second dose but before getting it for I'd say 2 weeks I was taking 1 or 2 daily magnesium taurate tablets leading up to my vaccination. right before getting my second dose I took a tablet, After my second dose I also took one. I had the usual chills and headache, that got fixed with paracetamol. I only had minimal chest pain the first day, that quickly got fixed and I had nothing since. After your vaccination continue taking 2 tablets a day for atleast 2 weeks I'd say even more will be better. 
When people reccomended magnesium supplements then say they didn't help they're not getting the one that specifically helps the heart, taurate is what you need. Hopefully this helps someone.",2021-12-15,3,POST

If you relate to my experience in any way please reply because it would be really comforting. I am a 24 yr old female, pretty healthy and active. I got my first two shots back in April (both Pfizer). After my second shot I had terrible flu-like side effects and the worst back pain of my life for about a week and I remember thinking it took almost a full month to feel better and get my energy back. I got my pfizer booster on 12/7 and kind of expected a similar experience. Within three hours I was shivering and could barely stay awake. The next day the flu-like symptoms began: splitting head ache, the weirdest nauseous feeling, BAD body aches, diarrhea, chills. It‚Äôs been a week and most of the symptoms have improved drastically besides the nauseous feeling (I feel worse in the morning?) I also get this weird pins and needles almost itchy feeling sometimes but consistently My chest has been hurting so badly. On Wednesday or Thursday I woke up gasping for air, my chest and heart feel really tight and sore almost like pressure. I wear a fit bit and track my heart rate pretty regularly. My resting heart rate is usually around or under 65 at the most. It‚Äôs now usually around 80 or 90. On the days I have had to go to work it‚Äôs been like 110 bpm all day. I‚Äôm exhausted. Luckily, I have an appointment for an ekg tomorrow morning. 
I‚Äôm sorry if this scares anyone. So so so many of my friends, family, and coworkers have gotten the vaccine and recovered quickly and or felt perfectly fine. I have always felt excited and willing to do what I can to protect myself and others from Covid but the vaccines damn near kill me. Oh and I wanted to add that I have never had Covid. 
Can anyone relate!!!!!

Got Moderna two weeks ago and dealing with the notorious heart inflammation side effect and all I can say is it sucks. No more MRNA vaccine for me in the near future, but I'm also hoping that we won't need additional shots after this. It sucks because I knew about the heart issue side effects before I got it, but they kept saying it was rare so I thought it wouldn't happen to me. Lo and behold, it does.
In the meantime, hunkering down mentally and taking Ibuprofen until this inflammation blows over. It took a huge hit on me mentality because my heart rate can go over 100 bpm for no reason, and I also use exercise to help improve my mental health but I can't do that for a while now. Was told that the recovery can take several weeks
:EDIT: Forgot to post my reactions after I got injected because I am upset with the heart issue
When they first injected me in my left shoulder, I noticed my left arm started feeling tingly down to my wrist.
I felt it within the first two hours of the shot: chills, elevated heart rate, and headache.
First couple day after booster, I notice when I play intense videos games, like Apex Legends, my heart was beating harder. Much harder then before. My neck also felt like it did swell up a bit when my heart was elevated because I noticed my airway didn't feel smooth when I breathe.
Now I'm dealing with the heart inflammation two weeks after.",2021-12-15,86,POST

11am Sunday: Received Moderna booster at CVS. No pain at injection site and felt fine for most of the afternoon. Did some yard work and some sketching, no symptoms yet. 
5pm: Injection arm beginning to get sore, hands and feet are cold and skin starting to become sensitive. 
8pm: Arm pain begins, whole body fatigued and sore at this point. It‚Äôs a deep muscle ache a bit more intense than the day after an intense workout, and stretching occasionally weirdly feels good. Moving hurts so I became horizontal and watched Netflix until bedtime.
11pm: Bedtime. Mild headache begins, no fever. Feel cold getting into bed but no chills. Heart is beating quite fast and hard. 
2am: Body feels quite warm instead of cold. Experience some insomnia but I manage to fall asleep after taking some antihistamines. 
9am: Wake up feeling pretty good. Still sore in arms and upper thighs but otherwise back to normal! 
I took a zinc pill and drank several cups of water + electrolytes during the 24h after shot, I‚Äôm not sure if it helped but my symptoms were relatively mild.

928,rfy2gg,May 4th vaccination follow up Carpal Tunnel,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rfy2gg/may_4th_vaccination_follow_up_carpal_tunnel/,CovidVaccinated," 
This is another follow up post about the Pfizer vaccine side effects I experienced. 
Recap- As I earlier mentioned I got my 2nd Pfizer shot on May 4 in my left arm, 18 days later on May 22 I got a weird tingling sensation in my Left arm, numbness in my left hand and the pins and needles sensation in my 4 fingers, but not thumb.
The tingling and numbness came and went for 4 days for a few hours every day, then stopped. On May 27 the neurological problems started about noon, became more intense, and lasted all day right up to going to bed after midnight. The next day the tingling, numbness and sensations in my 4 fingers started subsiding.
On May 29, only my left hand and 4 fingers had the odd new sensations. Over the next 2 weeks the numbness in my left hand subsided to just around my pinky finger that still had the pins and needles sensation. That is still a problem. I won't go into the cardiac problems I also experienced and still do, because this only about the neurological vaccine side effects.
In July I went to a Neurologist, about my newfound problem. I mentioned to him about the 4 women at Condell Hospital in Illinois that got vaccinated December 19, 2020, and within minutes to hours they had the same problems I experienced 18 days later. I also told him about my new heart issues. The Dr. told me he is sure the vaccine had nothing to do with my new problems. When I mentioned the 4 women at Condell, he said he had not heard of that, like I was making it up. He also said even though my new cardio problem showed up in the same 3-week time frame my neurological problems showed up, he is sure they are not related.
He did test for Carpal tunnel syndrome, EMG and some other stuff, and said I had it. I mentioned to him that with carpal tunnel syndrome, the Thumb is always affected, but rarely is the Pinky finger, and my Thumb never had the pins and needles sensation, and now only my Pinky finger does. He quickly dismissed my concerns. I have never had any type of job that could cause carpal tunnel.
Last December 19, 2020 when the 4 women at Condell had their problems, Pfizer said it was due to the injection needled being inserted too far in their arm. As more and more women complained about that side effect, Pfizer told our CDC and the Ministry of Health in Israel it is ""just hysterical women"" having post vaccine anxiety. Really, that is what Pfizer said. In February Pfizer said their vaccine does not cause any possible neurological side effects.
In October Pfizer documented that their vaccine caused Carpal Tunnel syndrome in 23 people.  I don't think they counted my report.   What has our FDA been doing all this time?   I have not seen 1 mainstream media article covering what people reported to VAERS.

First, it beat me into the ground with the flu-like side effects. That was tough.

Just really, really cold, achy, tired.
And hungry.
Like, insatiable, must-eat-everything kind of hungry, right about the time the side effects started kicking in.
I have to believe it‚Äôs just the body trying to use protein to build the spike protein and the body wanting resources to build the antibodies AGAINST those, but man‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt experience it like this before.

I'm not an anti-vaxxer, just hesitant. Please help me with this if you can, but keep the anti-vaxx agenda out of this. I'm not here to get attacked, just advice from people.
I'm having problems deciding whether to go for a booster. After my second Moderna shot, the worst side effect I had was being so feverish I was in bed all day. I had such a high fever that I got high from it, hallucinating and such, pretty much between wokeness and sleep.
Still, nothing permanent and certainly wasn't an ordeal.
I told my mom that I wouldn't be getting a third if that ever became a thing at the time, and she was like ""No, I wouldn't either"". Ofcourse, that was then and this is now.
My problems that keep me from getting this vaccine are:
 - Almost everything is closing down here again (Netherlands), so what's the point of getting it if I barely go anywhere? Even if it's getting mandatory or required.
 - Never in my life did I have such a strong reaction to any vaccine, and it feels like taking a risk at this point. (Ofcourse, getting covid is as well, but given the first point, IDK why I would be so open to risk of getting it).
 - I hoped I'd be done with it if I take the first 2 doses, this clearly isn't the case. Who is to say that it would end here? Maybe there's going to be many more boosters needed. In that case, it seems ""safer"" to just not take any vaccine unless I have to go somewhere again.
Please don't get me wrong, I'm glad I got fully vaccinated, and if I could turn back time I'd do it again. It's just that given my previous experience, I don't think it's a good idea anymore, and I hope something or someone can change my mind. After all, I'm part of the group that wants this to be over.
The first dose I just had the classic pain in arm (also a stronger reaction than I ever had, but one that was known), but the second was way worse. I'm just thinking of it as a ""trend"" that if I take more, will only increase.
What do you think? Should I go for it? So far, I'm really mixed about it. People just tend to shift from the first normal to the next.",2021-12-13,3,POST

No headache or anything else like last time. Blood pressure was up a little today highest was 130/90 it's back at 124/79 now which is about normal for me. Could have been my anxiety etc. Will update tomorrow. So far milder than the first shot.

I have body aches a headache and feel a little hot here and there and was tired but unable to fall asleep. When I did I only slept a few hours at a time. Took my first Tylenol this morning to help. So far it feels a little more mild than my first shot.
12-13 evening: I slept a lot today. Feel like I'm getting over a cold. not a lot of energy. body aches and headache feel way better after my last nap. Feel like I'm getting better slowly. Didn't have much of a fever today if any since early this morning. Did take Tylenol twice today to help. I think tomorrow I will feel way better. Mainly body aches small headache and just no energy today. Blood pressure, heart rate, and 02 levels are all normal today.
12-14: I feel much better today! about 90% or so. no body aches. my blood pressure is slightly higher than normal around 120/90 , but I've been drinking straight sugar-free Gatorade which has salt in it so I'm suspecting that's why. Going to go on a walk today like normal. Much more energy and overall feeling good.
12-14 Evening: Still feeling pretty good. I still don't have all of my energy back and I am a little weak at times. Appetite comes and goes still some. Blood pressure and everything else is fine. didn't need a nap today and I was able to fall asleep easier last night. Hoping tomorrow is even better!
12-15: I went back to work today. Feeling good still. some small abdominal pain ( possibly trapped gas ) kinda comes and goes. Not as weak today as yesterday. Did a 2 mile walk today when I got home. BP and HR are normal.
12-16 : almost 100% back to normal. no fatigue or weakness issues. did a 3 mile walk today. Blood pressure was good today was 117/82 right before typing this. Feeling good so far with no more issues. Last night was the first night I was able to fall asleep easily since my shot. Hoping that continues! my appetite is pretty much all the way back also.
12-17: Another normal day. Normal Blood pressure and everything else.
12-18: Also a normal day. Nothing to report :)
12-19: 7 days since my booster. Normal day here.

970,rea4i9,Help me convince my dad to get vaccinated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/rea4i9/help_me_convince_my_dad_to_get_vaccinated/,CovidVaccinated,"A little background: I (an only child, 18y/o F) had covid plus pneumonia in late January through the entirety of February of 2021, and almost had to go to the hospital. My dad (and later my mom) tested positive for covid in September of 2021. My dad is a TSA agent, my mom (vaccinated before getting covid) is a high school teacher. We live in Louisiana (at this point my dad was stationed in a Mississippi airport, but he is back in New Orleans as of now.)
My dad (48 y/o) refuses to get the vaccine. He is a stubborn Republican who refuses to listen to the CDC, Dr. Fauci, WHO, or any ""reliable"" source. He refuses to listen to me, my mom (47y/o), his mother, who was a former nurse, or any of my mom's coworker friends (one who is so radical she calls California ""Commiefornia"").
We are a lower-middle class family who lives in southern Louisiana, about an hour and a half away from New Orleans. He works for TSA, so he needs a vaccination or else he will get fired at some point in the near future. He is trying to get an exemption, but it will most likely not work. I am on his health insurance, which is essential since all three of us have underlying conditions and constantly visit doctors. If he gets fired, I will have to be on my mother's insurance, and we all know how useless the Louisiana school system is (especially in St. Tammany parish).
My dad has said and I quote, ""If I need to work three jobs so I don't have to do one thing, so be it."" He has shown no remorse for me or my mother for getting covid, and the fact that I had to almost be hospitalized because of this. I struggled in school due to the severe brain fog I endured and was not able to get vaccinated until I graduated (early May). My mom, had she not gotten the vaccine, would have probably had to have been hospitalized, as she is the most high risk out of all of us.
I struggle with debate skills and get wrapped up in my emotions too quickly. I am asking for help regarding convincing my dad on getting the vaccine. He believes that more people are dying because of the vaccine itself, and refuses to listen to the sources I have listed above. I am desperate and am in urgent need of any sources, debate tips, or factual evidence from doctors and/or scientists if this reaches them. Reddit, please do your job.

I woke up at 4am, desperately thirsty even though I'd had plenty of water before bed, and tossed and turned until 7, with sweats and chills again. I gave up on trying to sleep and had some ibuprofen. After about an hour of feeling like crap I was luckily able to nap until 10. That quality sleep was incredibly rejuvenating, and I was able to take a shower and now, at noon, I'm feeling a lot better.

Onset: More than a month, around a month and a half, after 2nd dose. Second dose in the middle of september. symptoms gradually getting worse but nothing obvious throughout october and getting severe in november. 
First dose: Pfizer, Second dose: Moderna 
I had no choice in having the moderna after pfizer. 
Taken extensive blood work, nothing is abnormal. No nutritional deficiences. No thyroid issues. No hormonal issues. Not diabetic or pre-diabetes. None of that. I‚Äôve taken magnesium and vitamin D daily for months, no differenxe. No inflammation. 
My current symptoms are muscle twitching, tremors, numbness and weakness. Whenever I stand for a longer period of time, my lower back starts feeling extremely heavy. BTW I‚Äôm a very young female, and never felt this way before. I have constant muscle twitches in my legs, that started in my left. Weakness also started in my left. I can‚Äôt walk for long without getting fatigue in my legs. My muscles strain from the smallest activities and I get random aches that are generally painless, this is in line with muscle atrophy.
From what I‚Äôve read, mRna can /possibly/ cause neurological issues like GBS etc. and it has been shown in a few cases. For me, it‚Äôs unlikely that it is GBS. This has lasted for more than a month for me and it has not subsided. It just progressively gets worse. I wish it was GBS because it‚Äôs seriously pointing out to be much serious than that. It‚Äôs not MS, as MS doesn‚Äôt cause muscle twitches. My experience is also painless which is actually a more worrying sign than not :( It‚Äôs extremely hard to get access to neurologist quickly where I‚Äôm from. I already can tell how it‚Äôs going to go. I‚Äôm a young woman so I know I‚Äôm going to be dismissed and gaslighted. In fact, I‚Äôve tried getting help from other places but only been dismissed. Even if I get diagnosed, no treatment or true help awaits me. Only clinical studies. I know it‚Äôs not going to subside (it‚Äôs progressively getting worse + hasnt waned in over a month) This shit is going to take me with it. I regret taking the vaccine so badly. It‚Äôs up to each person, but I genuinely hope people think before getting their 2nd shot or even first. Especially young people. I was healthy before this.

Had three Pfizer doses in May, June (4 weeks after) and December (5 months and a bit after).
Each time the only effect was mild pain at injection site, which was a relief. The only thing that I would say is that, being quite conscious about side effects (especially heart inflammation), I have avoided strenuous physical activity for \~7 days each time.  Not sure if it was needed but better be safe than sorry.
I feel really grateful for vaccines and although it seems like Omicron may be a bit of a challenge for 2022, I am hoping we are slowly but surely getting out of this situation.",2021-12-11,15,POST

Only minor thing I would add is I believe studies have shown that Troponin levels drop about \~14 days after acute myocarditis so just because that is clear doesn't mean that you do not have myocarditis.

Colchicine is only used off-label for treating pericarditis. The jury is definitely still out on whether it has merit; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7392355/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7392355/)

Social media has been pushing that, too. Since there is no room for nuance in most parts. It has been boiled down to a binary. Either you are on the in group or you are not and it has gotten worse with time. 
Trust the science has been reduced to ""trust the talking TV heads."" And since most people don't actually read Academic Journals, or are fairly scientifically illiterate, they will just follow whatever they are told. 
If this was actually about science or any other therapeutic, there would be an open dialogue. 
Case in point, some lettuces get some people sick, there is a national recall and makes the 6 o'clock news. There are millions of adverse events and tens of thousands of dead here or more here and in Europe and it gets black holed.
Or as you said, end up getting treated like a leaper by the in-cult people who may mean well in their heads but do not know better. 
I got banned from Worldnews for posting valid articles from reputable, and well known sources from Iceland regarding high hospitalizations in the people who got shots.

This.
The antivaxxers literally make the same claims about every vaccine. Only the name of the vaccine changes. The polio vaccine ""causes infertility"" which seems weird since this vaccine is universally administered and in the sixty plus years it's been used, the world's population has tripled.
My husband's extended family and my extended family have all been vaccinated including my 91 year old father and 85 year old mother. Even the Trump supporters are fully vaccinated (they work in health care and saw the pre-vaccine devastation). The only side effects have been at most a few days of flu symptoms.
Both Joni Mitchell and Neil Young had polio as children. There's a reason why they don't like anti-vaxxers. I've seen the devastation that occurred before some vaccines were available as well.",2022-02-01,2,COMMENT

Data so far indicates that mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) offer the most promising protection against both infection and hospitalization, in line with the CDC‚Äôs recommendations.

Take case fatality rate for example. Since risk of death is so dependent on age, average risk overestimates risk for younger people while it highly underestimates risk for people over the age of 60 or older, where CFR was almost 50% in some pension homes. So average change in menstruation has very limited meaning.
On top of that, I suspect that these changes are highly underreported. Whether it be because of stigma of talking about it, limited possibility of being able to report it or it be doctors just not making the connection.

https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2021/12/09/fda-says-it-needs-75-years-to-release-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-data-to-the-public/
For those who don't know, a bunch of Doctors submitted a Freedom of Information Request to the FDA back in August or September 2021, to get the Pfizer trial raw data to ascertain that they were safe as per their marketing. Pfizer came back with that they would do just that... In 55 years. 
No joke. 
They went to court and the FDA/Pfizer responded, changing their original 55 year estimate... To 75 years. 
Once again, back in legal proceedings, a Judge told them to go to hell and to do it in 8 months. Which is where we are today. 
Yeah, it totally does not sound like a company that has paid $2.3 billion in fines for falsifying data or used bribes not even barely a decade ago.

Edit: For those wondering, they already started giving some of the data through the FOIA.

‚ÄúVaccine effectiveness is a scientific method used to measure how well a vaccine protects people against outcomes such as infection, symptoms, hospitalisation and death in the ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô. Unlike case rates, vaccine effectiveness analysis accounts for potential biases in the data and risk factors such as age, sex, prior infection, co-morbidities, socio-economic status, and time since vaccination. This method is the most robust way to measure if a vaccine is working.
The data and rates presented in this section do not account for these biases and risk factors and should not be used to measure vaccine effectiveness. We include links to vaccine effectiveness studies below.‚Äù

The document actually addresses this on page 34 :
*The data and rates presented in this section do not account for these biases and risk factors and should not be used to measure vaccine effectiveness. We include links to vaccine effectiveness studies below.*
*There is likely to be systematic differences and biases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, such as behaviour, vulnerability and previous infection, that are
unaccounted for when comparing rates. As most of the population is vaccinated, these differences become more evident and could create bias in case/hospitalisation/death rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated population. For example, people who are vaccinated may be more likely to follow other government guidance such as regular testing and reporting for COVID-19, which makes them more likely to be identified as a case than unvaccinated people, resulting in higher case rates in the vaccinated population.*
They refer [to this post for more example of bias in data](https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2021/11/02/transparency-and-data-ukhsas-vaccines-report/).",2022-02-02,10,COMMENT

259,s8uvaa,"In rare cases, coronavirus vaccines may cause Long Covid‚Äìlike symptoms",https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccinated/comments/s8uvaa/in_rare_cases_coronavirus_vaccines_may_cause_long/htiusvn/,CovidVaccinated,"There was a study like 4-5 months ago that said it was not rare at all. However, it claimed that it was not very serious to most people. I think people need to understand that the culprit here is the Spike protein. Whether you get it through Covid or through the vaccine, the spike protein --not the Covid virus in this case-- still interacts with your body's cells and the damage it causes is what lingers. Or rather your immune system response to the damage and inflammation, this is why some people test negative even after a long while. The long Covid folks.
The main difference is that when you get Covid, it usually stays in your lungs, unless you are sickly, or old. Then it can spread. With the shot, it can get around your body even though it has been claimed that it mostly stayed in the injection site.  But we don't know why it does that to some and maybe not to others. I have a best friend who ended up with some heart/chest issues and it lasted for more than 3 months. Got tested for a few things and they all came negative. He got chastised for bringing up the possibility that it could have been the shot.  Another guy I know has similar issues, but what was different with him is that he claims that he tasted the shot once he got it, some type of metalic flavour seconds after he got it if that makes sense. Which is just weird. My best friend did not. 
What the shot does however is that it lowers your lymphocyte count, the study checked after 28 days and they found this to be the case. They did not know for how long your body is affected but they also assumed that it was not for too long after that. I think they check for 40 or so days after. But they simply did not know as it went beyond the length and scope of the study itself. 
I will see if I can find the study regarding the lymphocyte count  again.

Found it. Where it touches on the shots mimicking infection.

Second Edit:
By the way, the powers that be are now trying to sell the idea that all of your side effects, for most of you, are all just in your head. WTF

Third edit:
I just got this on one of my feeds. The NIH has/had been investigating the Covid mimicking of the vaccines. In fact, they were investigating it even earlier than the Nature study I knew of, and that I had posted earlier. Since before Summer 2021. They even left the victims high and dry and in the dark. Notice at the bottom that they recently updated the article as to add the NIH's and EMA's (European Medicines Agency) rebuttal/statements that they care.

The lack of mass-sample, longitudinal Phase 4 clinical trials is precisely why I initially decided to hold on getting this therapy. Now I‚Äôm called an ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù even though I emphatically  support the usage of nearly every other vaccine that has shown statistically significant promise after at least 5 years of phase 4 clinical trials. 
I used to routinely research various signaling pathways involving mRNA and the links between diabetes and breast/ovarian cancers.

Your body clears the actual vaccine particles out within about 48 hours of you being vaccinated, then it stops reacting to the vaccine. If your reaction lasts longer, it means there is something else in there it is fighting off.

I have heard (and experienced myself) that when your body is fighting an infection or is in the process of  healing from an injury (broken bones, abrasions, etc) the mind can experience a deficit of cognitive function.
I've also been told that a lack in autoimmune function can result in similar issues as it takes a larger toll on the autoimmune system. 
Personally I suffer from Hashimoto's Thyroiditis which essentially causes my body to gradually kill my thyroid gland, thus rendering it basically useless. This kinda sucks because it impairs autoimmune function which makes it harder for my body to make use of vaccines and such. 
Anyway. Folks with thyroid diseases in particular are highly susceptible to depression and other mood disorders.
So TLDR: I am convinced that immune functions can directly impact one's mental well being.

My second shot didn't worsen those symptoms. Obviously, your symptoms are worse than mine, but you're the first person I've seen with the same initial distribution (all limbs plus one half of the face).
I threw my 'witch doctor' cabinet at it when I got those symptoms - melatonin, quercetin, a multivit, liposomal C, D, and glutathione. Maybe those helped, maybe they didn't.
I had no investigations and my GP called the local hospital to ask if anyone else had come through with those symptoms - they said 1 in about 10,000. But I suspect paraesthesias are quite a bit more common than that. I suppose you can take some reassurance from the fact your scans were clear, even though that doesn't explain the mechanism by which you got those symptoms.

It sounds a lot like POTS. See if you can get your doctor to give you a referral for testing. I actually have a type called hyperpots. I get tachycardia from jolts of adrenaline that happen when I'm falling asleep. My sympathetic nervous system apparently thinks REM sleep is very dangerous and it triggers a adrenaline release which jolts me awake and gives me palpitations. My symptoms started after I received a DTAP vaccine in 2015. POTS can result from an illness, vaccine injury, major surgery, or bodily trauma. Here is a very good series of videos on the subject:

The A on the end refers to the acid form. The acid form (CBDA or THCA) turns into the decarboxylated form (CBD or THC) when burned or exposed to sunlight. At that point the THC for example is ready to get you high. To get the acid forms, you need really low processed oil or simply plant matter, where the acids haven't been decarboxylated yet.

So i chose to give in and get the vaccine and here we are now. 
I took an Uber and went out to get vaccinated and was only there for 30min then called another ride and went home.

It's that doctors are often just really defensive when they don't know something. The doctors you're seeing genuinely do not know what's wrong with you and how to help you. But they feel like they need to give you an answer, probably because patients have talked down to them before for not having an answer, or maybe they're just insecure as hell regardless. It's really obnoxious and when doctors say something is ""psychosomatic"" or ""just anxiety"" it feels like they're being condescending most of the time.

I know 80% of all autoimmune diseases happen in women, but I still have no family history of it. I've posted this before, but scientists have been saying that because women are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, their vaccine doses should [really be](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406660/) individualized so they get the protection they need without triggering a potentially lifelong autoimmune disease and/or [worse side effects than males](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00281-018-0726-5).

Having gone through r/covidlonghaulers and r/vaccinelonghaulers, I'm even more convinced they're the same thing: an inflammatory response to the spike protein binding to ACE2 receptors throughout the body, leading to an autoimmune reaction.
I posted this in another comment with a link to the science, but I do think the dose needs to be lower for certain populations (women; young healthy people; those already with autoimmune conditions) so they can get the protection they need without accidentally [triggering an autoimmune reaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264276/), which in some cases, can be worse than COVID itself (like with me; there's no other logical reason why a respiratory illness would make one's left *arm* numb unless some sort of autoimmune reaction happened).",2022-02-01,1,COMMENT

The data is clear: Natural immunity is not better. The COVID-19 vaccines create more effective and longer-lasting immunity than natural immunity from infection.
More than a third of COVID-19 infections result in zero protective antibodies
Natural immunity fades faster than vaccine immunity

Unvaccinated does not mean immune naive - some will have had previous infections.  Your friend imagines unvaccinated actually means unvaccinated and not previously infected.
Second, vaccination rate grows with age. Older age also means more likely to feel sick and get tested.
In any case, gazing at charts just isn't as good as testing and measuring - see https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044481/Technical-Briefing-31-Dec-2021-Omicron_severity_update.pdf for recent data out of the UK.
Also from a point of theory & experience boosters should be predicted to provide a stronger and longer lasting response - see the immune memory chart below:

Just feel around. Do you feel any swollen lymph nodes? It's just a sign your body is responding to the vaccine properly and should resolve in time. Vaccines are large doses of a antigen designed to produce a robust response. It's a novel antigen as well so those tend to be stronger the first couple of times around. The body is spinning up thousands of recombinant immune cells, then testing which ones complement the antigen then the ones that don't match will be killed off. Lymph nodes will swell as B cells begin to divide and spew out antibodies and T cells replicate in preparation for fighting a infection.",2022-01-30,3,COMMENT

It's still worth it. The booster may not help you from getting infected due to omicron being more vaccine resistant, but it will still prevent severe illness and death, which always makes it worth it. The risks of severe illness and death due to covid still outweigh any risks of adverse side effects of the vaccine.
I do agree that if you have concerns you should speak to your doctor, because they will know your personal medical history and be able to advise you properly, rather than strangers on the internet.

I do think you're forgetting to address that something like 30% of people with covid get long-term symptoms. Covid doesn't miss young healthy people just because we're less likely to end up in the hospital. The thought of not being able to smell or taste, or of losing my lung capacity, or developing CFS? No thank you lmao. That's why I'm vaccinated personally.
I disagree with the conclusions you're drawing from your data (and notice that you primarily seem to take issue with mRNA/Pfizer, which is definitely not your only option) but I don't really want to get into an argument about it. Just here to give my perspective on the ""booster"" thing specifically.
How many boosters you're recommended to get shouldn't factor into your decision to take the vaccine. Boosters aren't unique to covid- I've gotten a flu vaccine almost every year of my life since I was a kid. I'm hoping to eventually get a booster that's specifically formulated for omicron/whatever the latest variant is, like how the flu vaccine switches up every year.
Plus, once transmission isn't so high I'm sure they'll stop being recommended for everyone. Yearly flu boosters are really only strongly recommended for immunocompromised people, kids, and seniors. The aim right now is just to make sure hospitals don't get overloaded, which is happening a lot because the flu + covid together is a double whammy.
I'm hoping the Novavax one gets approval though, I've heard good things and it uses the same tech as the flu vaccine",2022-02-01,13,COMMENT

I can't say I'm not glad you're considering getting vaccinated, but I hope you're able to make an informed decision without being coerced into it.
I don't know of any medications that would interact with a vaccine. My sister was on an SSRI, she was fine, and my mom was on medication for hypertension, she was also fine. I can't know if it's the same ones, obviously, but meds shouldn't matter. Like a lot of people are saying, though, that's a question for your doctor. 
I do know that some young people are more likely to have adverse side effects to certain vaccines (like Pfizer and pericarditis/myocarditis in young men). I didn't really care going into it because I was more concerned about having long-term symptoms if I were to get covid, or about transmitting it to others. 
Then again, I got J&J, learned the next day that there was a risk of blood clots, and the statistics didn't keep me from worrying if I would be one of the 1 in a million lmao. We all do risk assessments differently.

You'd think this would be my mother's job to convince him but he just doesn't like her enough to respect her opinion and she's too involved in her job to take the time to make a convincing argument instead of condescending comments.
Anyway, your story gave me some motivation to try again with him tomorrow, but I doubt he'll listen to me. I don't know at what point I just have to make peace with the fact they're all making dumb decisions and there's only so much I can do. its got to the point where its really made me upset and unpleasant a lot of the time.",2022-02-01,7,COMMENT

Just to be sure. If it's per 1 million, and males under 40 get 100 cases. It would be feasable to suggest that thous 100 cases were severe enough to detect and make case for. Knowing doctors like to dismiss, downplay and suggest other cases (go back home and rest).
So I would think something like this. For every 1 severe there is 10 less severe and so on. Just having 3-4 groups, one could easily get:
100 - 1000 - 10 000 - 100 000
Which would make it maybe  1/10 you get small scale heart inflammation. With something so common, it would end up depending on other cases, which could increase inflammation: food, medicine, precondition, stress, exercise, sauna etc.
One could then suggest, but you could multiple indefinitely and always get 1/1 chance. Maybe, because there are 0 cases for females in same age group!",2022-02-01,3,COMMENT

I'm not saying people shouldn't or should get vaccinated. I'm just saying its very important to weigh the risks and the benefits and to understand the risk for you for covid.

[Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1931)",2022-01-31,11,COMMENT

A typical vaccine trial is run until a pre-determined number of disease cases have occurred among the trial subjects. This may take 5 years. The covid vaccine trials were run during a raging epidemic of a highly transmissible disease. The target cases were reached in weeks. 
A typical drug trial is analyzed and submitted to the FDA. The FDA puts the submission on it's queue and gets to it when they get to it (and they're chronically underfunded). The drug company submissions for the covid vaccines were given first priority and the FDA was already looking at the data before the official submission.

What I never get why people can't do simple research. I wrote it in another post and gonna add it here too. The Pfizer vaccine has two nano lipides called ALC-0159 and ALC-0315 as ingredients. They are produced by Cayman Chemicals in the US. A quick search on their website will yield the safety data sheets of the chemicals. The first thing that should really catch the eye and I quote ""This product is for research use -not for human or veterinary diagnostic and therapeutic use"". So the company that actually produces part of the stuff that gets injected into people says you shouldn't inject that stuff into you. A quick glance on the side effects of those chemicals would probably also make it pretty clear why it shouldn't be injected. Again this is not my oppinion but that of the company producing that stuff.

I think even if you are not a chemist those safety data sheets should give you a good impression what you are putting into your body or with what side effects just two of the base materials are associated with.

ACCELERATED TIMELINE IN A PANDEMIC  
Some clinical trial phases are combined  
Well that's nice. Don't get me started on the 3-6 month efficacy and the fact it was designed for alpha strain and not the mainstream delta. Are you going to keep taking it until the 8th booster? The third and (some places fourth) boosters are coming up soon \^\_\^  
Did you know that unvaccinated people have been found to have a very similar viral load to fully vaccinated people? And that because vaccinated people will have less symptoms it is easier for them to transmit that viral load because they dont know they are sick? But dont bother googling the top notch educational resources reporting this. Just ignore me and downvote instead, and go back to your happy little echo chamber.  
If the vaccine is effective at protecting yourself, why do you care if young healthy people take it? That has nothing to do with you, contrary to what Pfizer would like you to believe. Did you know that Pfizer paid the largest criminal fine in history at $2.3 billion for lying? They sound like some really honest trustworthy people and I can't wait to inject them into my body.  
Upset because the liberal media echo chamber isn't telling you anything? Maybe you should question more and review more news sources and studies, because guess what, every news source is biased and has an agenda. They are private news media corporations and they do not give a shit about you, nor does the random journalist spreading their opinion piece as fact.  
Step 1) Classification: Unvaccinated  
Step 2) Symbolisation: Plague-rats, anti-vaxxers, covidiots, etc  
Step 3) Discrimination: Vaccine passports, job exclusion, social exclusion, businesses closed, travel denied, education denied  
Step 4) Dehumanisation: They dont care, they are evil, Everything is their fault, they are insane, They are holding us back  
Step 5) Organisation: Australian quarantine camps, Austrian forced compulsory vaccination, Extreme forced lockdowns (China), Mass-media narrative to demonize the unvaccinated, Extremely excessive lockdowns in democracies  
Step 6) Polarisation: Claim that they are anti-vaccine when they are obviously anti-mandate, understate the size of protests (say thousands instead of tens of thousands), Censor and block users from describing adverse reactions on places like Tik-Tok, Youtube... Publish pieces in the media that make everyone hate the unvaccinated (""Anti-Vaxxers Hate Chapmans Ice Cream!""), Conflate the unvaccinated with pre-pandemic anti-vaxxers even though they took all previous vaccines before the pandemic  
Step 7) Preparation: Deny them travel, businesses, jobs, so they are homeless and destitute, exclude them from all services (even surgery) if they are not vaccinated, the list goes on...  
Step 8 ) Persecution: Shut down their businesses, lock them in their homes if they still have one, prevent them from going anywhere except the grocery store, make society afraid of them with daily Two Minutes Hate articles in all major media designed to ostracize them from the community.  
Step 9)  
Step 10)  
By the way, in case you are confused or wondering, Coronavirus is never going away, just like the flu didn't after the 1920 pandemic. This is not going to end unless we have some major medical breakthrough in virology or design a vaccine that actually works properly and not ""sort-of"".  
Don't just agree with everyone else and be a little parrot. Grow a brain for yourself and research this. If you are vaccinated, great, but don't fucking force your garbage on me.  
Don't forget, you are not allowed to question this vaccine or disagree ever, that is simply not socially acceptable. Having hesitations and not wanting an experimental medical treatment that many of us don't even need is no longer socially acceptable. How does that freedom taste?  
None of this should make you mad at the unvaccinated, we just want you to fuck off with your mandates. Dont tell us we need to put garbage in our body just because you like to. if you are putting on your >:( NPC face right now, that's because you hate it when someone disagrees with you and is right, and you are a fascist who does not support people having medical choice. Owch, your big fat ""always has to be right and force it on everyone else"" ego right? Looking forward to your essay replying to this on my desk by Monday. Have a great day everyone!

After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

No one is reporting that patients with vaccine induced myocarditis are struggling to recover.
All data points to full recovery within a couple of weeks.

***What is myocarditis?
Quite simply, ‚ÄúMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle,‚Äù says Erica Spatz, MD, MHS, a Yale Medicine cardiologist, ‚Äúand there's a range of different symptoms and levels of severity of myocarditis. Most often the inflammation is mild, and we treat it with anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or a prescription medication called colchicine,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMyocarditis, in most cases, gets better on its own without medical intervention.‚Äù In rare cases, it can cause arrhythmia or weakness of the heart.***

***Acute myocarditis
Acute myocarditis describes relatively recent or fast onset of myocarditis, and is usually caused by a viral infection. Acute myocarditis can develop suddenly, and symptoms may resolve rapidly as well.***",2022-01-30,18,COMMENT

If you are vaccinated, you can't be an asymptomatic carrier. You only carry the virus if you are infected, whereas the Antiva can carry it whenever they come in contact with it.
You also aren't a variant factory - that isn't how variants are made.
It's not a highly ineffective vaccine, either. It It does wane, but this isn't unheard of. Many vaccines require multiple doses to be effective.",2022-01-30,163,COMMENT

If your research does not bear that out, it‚Äôs likely you are not doing good research (sources are not reliable/you don‚Äôt understand how to distinguish between credible and untrustworthy sources).

Yes, generally antigen tests that use lateral flow are less sensitive and specific than RT-PCR tests, so repeated testing is preferred with the former. Timing is also a consideration, as viral replication rates vary across individuals, and therefore viral loads that are sufficient to be detectable will occur at different times post-exposure (e.g., 1-7 days). To the OP, if you've tested negative every day over a 1-week period, it's extremely unlikely that you were the vector for your friends' infections, especially since they had all gone to large congregate setting (a concert) which I'd consider high-risk.",2022-01-30,8,COMMENT

Also, I don't understand how you could possibly claim there were ZERO (edit: you said less than zero, that's impossible) studies done on these vaccines. That's preposterous, first of all because mRNA vaccines have been studied for over 20 (edit: actually more like 30) years, and secondly because people have been in clinical trials from the moment they decided to use mRNA technology for the covid vaccine. My husband was in a study back in late 2020, sure you could say he took an experimental vaccine but once it became approved by the FDA, even just for emergency use, it is no longer experimental. That means that there was enough evidence to show safety and efficacy. Long term, yes there are still ongoing studies for both safety and efficacy, but most vaccines that cause any side effects or adverse effects will show in the first few weeks of injection.",2022-01-30,12,COMMENT

I'm going to redefine some words here to show the power of language on thought.
First, instead of ""immunity"" I'm going to use the word ""resistance.""  Because even though we get it via the ""immune system"" it's really more of an ability to fight off an infection before it takes hold, as opposed to a blanket get-out-of-sick-free card.
Also the term ""natural immunity"" is emotionally charged.  I'm going to use ""infection induced resistance"" and ""vaccine induced resistance.""  Neither covid infection nor vaccination are ""natural"" for your body, but ""natural"" sounds better.
So just by tweaking that language, let's ask your question again.  Why would you choose to take the vaccine if you already got covid and have infection induced resistance?  
The answer is because any resistance, including infection induced resistance drops over time, and it can be enhanced.
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg9175
If you think of yourself as having ""natural immunity"" then why would you want more immunity?  If you think of yourself as having natural resistance, well, more resistance is great if you can cut your odds of getting sick in half.
Note that this isn't anything particularly new.  ""Immunity"" is not and never has been a one-and-done.  We've known this for ages; the tetanus vaccine has been recommended every ten years for a while now.  The hepatitis vaccine has been a three-dose for ages.
Don't let the fact that we use a word with an absolute meaning to describe a relative level of protection trick you into thinking you're absolutely protected!
If you've been infected already, I can't tell you how to feel about roll the dice on re-infection.  But I can say you *are* rolling the dice, just with lower odds than the first time you got sick.",2022-01-30,5,COMMENT

My risk of being infected with the coronavirus is also very low in general. Especially due to my lifestyle, like working from home (and loving it), having a small network of friends, introverted hobbies and actively wearing masks, my risk of being infected is very low, perhaps near zero. 
My risk of developing serious adverse reactions to the vaccines are also very low. However, when I take the vaccine, I intentionally expose myself to that risk, and I am guaranteed that risk. 
On top of that, the vaccines aren‚Äôt even that good. They are not some magical guarantee of immunity, and aren‚Äôt as effective as one would expect from a vaccine. On top of that, 2/3 of the vaccines that have been available to me, are now no lingered offered to me because the risk profile is too high.

Although, i did have cold during christmas, cold and runny nose, chills , a bit tired but no loss of taste or smell (not sure if it was covid, took a test and they damaged it so couldn‚Äôt test) it got clear with cold and flu meds. I took at home antigen - both negative
But i was so shocked by the booster reaction. Like itching all over and hyper sensitive to clothes i was wearing. And the chills was just the meds working i guess. 
Idk I‚Äôm going to consider the next booster, it shouldnt have been allergic at all.

That this is happening in a first grade country and not in a 3rd world country with incompetent doctors, is horrible. And that it is happening as we are nearly in 2022 after the vaccine has been rolled out for such a long time, is under all critique.
There might also be additional safety issues with vaccine in some cases. Regardless how much people want the vaccine to be totally safe, it might not be in some cases and they might even be covering this up just for pfizer to make money or to try and force the vaccine so countries can 'open back up again'. But if the vaccine is hurting and killing people you just have to wait longer, sorry!  The cure must not be worse than disease, and the cure can't be so bad that it literally kill you or damage your heart, and then have idiots that just say ""oh this is fine because atleast it prevents more deaths from covid"" That's an unacceptable risk to have and forces people to play russian roulette like this is SICK AND TWISTED.
But this example is blatant intravenous injection by mistake which you are not supposed to. And who knows how many this has happened to, but it's very clear that if you inject the pfizer vaccine into your blood stream you risk or are almost guaranteed to develope myocarditis. Which is basically permanent damage to your heart..
And i wonder if they cover up these deaths and just pretend covid killed them.
So you can imagine if you prioritize people with weak hearts for the vaccine, and then some IDIOT inject it directly into the blood stream, what do you think is going to happen? Are they going to have a heart attack and die? very likely.
I WANT THE VACCINE FORCERS TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND ASK THEIR VILLAINOUS SELVES HOWCOME IF THEY THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING SMOOTHLY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT TO BELIEVE, HOW AT THIS POINT THIS IS EVEN CAPABLE OF HAPPENING? HOW THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT TO EVEN CHECK IF THEY INJECT IT PROPERLY BUT INSTEAD SCREAM AT ANYONE WHO QUESTIONS ANYTHING ABOUT VACCINE ADMINISTERING.

I'm a little skeptical that this is what I have, because I looked it up, and found fact-checking reports saying the COVID vaccine has not been found to cause it, and it was falsely reported from Facebook. I also have no rash on my body, just in my mouth.
I'm not saying it's impossible for anyone to get it from the vaccine, it has been seen before with other vaccines, but it's so so so rare that I doubt that is what is happening with mine.

India
<div class=""paragraphs""><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is yet to approve the vaccine for emergency use authorisation (EUA).</p></div>
 
December 2020 -Trouble started with the company's application for Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) approval in December 2020 ñ which lacked data that supported that the vaccine actually prevented the disease.
January 2021- Covaxin, lauded as India's first indigenous vaccine against COVID-19, received emergency use authorization from the Centre in January. It has been used in India's nationwide inoculation programmed, along with Covishield, since the very beginning in January 2021.
Participants at the biggest site of a Covaxin clinical trial, Bhopal-based Peopleís Hospital, alleged mistreatment. The two sponsors of the trial ñ Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) ñ denied it, calling it baseless.
March 2021- In March, Brazil's vaccine regulatory body Anvisa pointed that the company had skipped some steps that made sure SARS-COV-2 virus in the vaccine was fully killed. It also pointed that the company did not have evidence to prove that the virus was ""incapable of multiplying in the human body.""  This came at a time when India had already administered nine million doses of the vaccine. Bharat Biotech Chairman called it 'Brazilian nationalism' and the report simply a means to keep an Indian vaccine out.
April 2021 - Bharat Biotech applied for WHO approval on 19 April, by providing Expression of Interest (EoI).
June 2021 - On 11 June, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), too, rejected Bharat Biotech's application for Covaxin approval.
Note: The FDAís refusal to grant emergency use authorization to the Indian drug makerís vaccine has been attributed to the lack of data made available on the clinical trials for the vaccine. The company had reportedly submitted only partial data of clinical trials, excluding Phase 3 trial data.  Krishna Ella's company then announced that it no longer intends to seek EUA from the US authority but a 'full approval.'
""Our US partner, Ocugen has received a recommendation from the FDA to pursue Biologics License Applications (BLA) path for Covaxin, which is full approval. All applications have to follow the BLA process, which is the standard process for vaccines. Therefore, for BLA, data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the marketing application submission for Covaxin. This process will extend our timelines.""
World Health Organization (WHO) has delayed the emergency use authorization for the vaccine, as it has more technical queries that Bharat Biotech needs to answer before it gets approval.
In the case of Covaxin, WHO rejected Bharat Biotech's EoI and said that 'more information is required.'
July 2021 - Almost three months later, the Centre told Parliament that all documents required for the WHOís nod have been submitted by 9 July.
September 2021 - Union Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar said on 24 September that the WHO was expected to grant the EUA to Covaxin soon.

I wanted to share as much as I can about this past year in the hopes it can help some of you with the same symptoms not take almost a year to diagnose. I'm a 29M (at the time 28) from NJ
I got my second dose of pfizer (batch numbers EN6206 and EP7534) on April 2nd, 2021. I did not have any symptoms from the first shot. Pretty much all of my immediate family had gotten their second dose already and seemed fine so I wan't expecting any trouble. I started off with the usual symptoms of a fever and fatigue that lasted a weekend but on the Sunday of that weekend I had a scare where all of a sudden when I was laying down, my heart started going berserk. Like it felt like an off beat followed by a rapid tachycardia. This happened for like 5 minutes then stopped. The next like 4 days or so I felt ok then I started to notice a weird feeling in my chest. I thought this was something that would clear up on its own but 1 week went by then a 2nd and I finally started telling my family about it asking for recommendations on a cardiologist.
It felt like a pressure of sorts that gradually evolved into chest tightness and got to a point where I couldn't take a deep breath without either some pain or my heart feeling like it was skipping a beat or something. I scheduled an appointment with a useless doctor named Dr.Christoforo (dont give a damn about revealing her name she should lose her license). Due to how long I had to wait, (month of May now) I wound up going to the hospital one night cause this was keeping me up and I had also began to look up if anyone was having similar symptoms after the shot. This was around the time that the first 6 cases of myocarditis after the vaxx was reported. I started to ask my brother and the people at the hospital if this is what was wrong. They weren't outright dismissive but very doubtful. I had an ekg, troponin blood test, and chest x-ray done all came back normal. The doc believed I may have heart my chest muscle in some way but my cardiologist would do further tests.
So the aforementioned doctor did give me a stress test, and a echocardiogram no contrast. These tests came back normal and at that point she wanted to completely clean her hands of me and just said it was probably anxiety you are too young for anything else. So I went another two months with no answers. In july I had some new symptoms of numbness in my legs and arms. Wasn't painful but it was scary cause I had no idea what it could be and it made walking very awkward. I also wound up with some weird rash on both my arms but that resolved in like 2 weeks. I wind up going to the hospital again for the same symptoms plus the new ones. The docs at the hospital weren't concerned with my chest issues but did run a head MRI to see if something was up with my nerves. Came back normal and was told its anxiety go see a therapist.
Fast forward to two weeks and the chest problems were at its worst. I went to a hospital a 3rd time because the chest tightness and pain was so intense and the left side of my head began to feel numb. My oxygen levels were good tho ( I have a device at home). This time I go to a different hospital and they were a little better but said it couldn't be the vaxx cause this wouldve happened way sooner or some jazz like that. I was able to convince them to give me a d-dimer ( at this point I was obsessively researching vaxx stuff, I knew it did this to me but just needed to find exactly what). The D-dimer came back normal which put me at ease. They admitted me after putting up resistance because they did another chest x-ray and blood work which came back normal and wanted to send me home. When I was admitted they had a neurologist, gastro doc, and another useless cardiologist who simply kept me on a ekg the entire time. During my blood tests, it showed that my lymphocytes were slightly elevated. The doctors told me not to read too much into it.
After a lot of blood tests and them giving me protonix in the event this was gastro related, my symptoms I came with started to get better. I could even take a deep breath now. However a couple days later at work, my heart began to act up with what I would later learn was either a couplet of PVC, PAC, which led to me having those stroke like symptoms again. It was bad and I actually thought I might be going into cardiac arrest. I called an ambulance on myself, by the time they got to me the symptoms started to resolve but not fully and the people on the ambulance spent all their time trying to convince me this was anxiety cause my vitals were good. I knew it was useless to go to the hospital so I took my chances driving home. Pulled over to the side of the road several times cause my symptoms were so bad and it was rush hour traffic. I actually thought there was a chance I might die, I called my mother and kept her on the phone with me for the remainder of the ride home. It was after this episode that I knew I had to be proactive with my own health since most of these health ""professionals"" were useless. I bought a holter monitor that I wear everyday.
During a visit to my grandmother at the hospital, I had another episode and thankfully because I bought the monitor, it picked it up. I would later learn when I showed this to my current doctor who would tell me it was Wide Range Tachycardia. I sent this ecg reading via email to my then Dr.Christoforo. The office called me and scheduled an appointment, seemed they were taking this seriously now. Unfortunately this doctor was very dismissive about the reading and others that I showed her (there were more but this is already a long read). She instead put me on their own holter monitor and refused to do further testing cause ""I'm too young for it to be anything serious"".
Since this is already going on very long (sorry) she handed me off to a doctor who specializes in electrical problems with the heart who wasn't really useless but he wrongfully diagnosed me as AFIB and wanted me to get a Catheter Ablation for it. This didn't sit right with me and I pushed for more tests but he refused due to me being ""too young for anything major"". At this point thankfully, my mother's boss knew of another cardiologist who heard about my problems and was able to see me right away! Where as all my previous appointments were pretty much a month apart. Within 1 DAY of hearing my story and seeing my holter monitor readings, he tells me he thinks I might have Myocarditis and scheduled a chest MRI with contrast and a CTA scan with contrast of the coronary arteries in case (since I have discomfort in that region too).
TLDR; So after 9 months my results of my chest MRI that other doctors refused to do, came back with Myocarditis with some scar tissue on my basal and mid inferior walls. There is some edema (swelling) still as well. My doctor wants to run the test again in 3 months. CTA came back normal. He says the prognosis is good its just gonna take a long time to heal. He thinks I should be more normal by the summer. I'm thinking it might be longer based on how I still feel but I'm glad the prognosis is great. If you read all this thank you. If you want the more important parts read the last two paragraphs. To everyone in here. PLEASE keep fighting, we have a chance but DO NOT take any more boosters. I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability. I am not doctor but I've learned alot from this experience and want to make sure other people don't take a year to get treatment.",2022-01-26,18,POST

These symptoms are constant but seem to peak every time I drive so now I am to the point where I can barely drive. My symptoms started immediately following the vaccine but it was about three days later when I learned they were not normal. I was driving home from school and a feeling of dizziness accompanied with symptoms similar to a panic attack over came me. After a ride in an ambulance and a visit to the hospital there wasn't much they could tell me. Soon after I began multiple lab test which to this date have included the following ekg, ct scan, mri, eye exam, blood pressure test, allergy panel, ultrasound of the liver. (I may be forgetting some at the moment) I was referred to an ENT specialist and did about 10 weeks of physical therapy for vertigo but it did not help to relieve the symptoms. This has caused me to move home from school and not being able to drive has been very frustrating. Has anyone else had similar side effects? Or any idea of how long these effects can possibly last?

10,sarh6y,Hello im forming a formal complaint and looking for victims with verified vaccine injury to include as evidence,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidvaccineinjury2/comments/sarh6y/hello_im_forming_a_formal_complaint_and_looking/,covidvaccineinjury2,"I have the 1000 studies
I have the 1000 expert statements
I have loads of supporting evidence of many  crimes 
What im missing is the group of those injured.  It seems to have yet to be formed.
I just need enough real people willing to make statements to open up investigations at the county levels worldwide.
Each person injured or dead is substantial- just need statements and names which would qualify as evidence in a court of law- a doctor recognizing vaccine injury helps.
Has this been done?  What are you guys thinking?  I think its time to gaggle
So lets see
If i can get 50 real people with verifiable stories to include in my case i think thats substantial
My goal is only to brute force the justice system to do its job and investigate everything forensically county by county- 
So in that case it will be helpful for all counties to have at least 5 dead/injured step forward
But really 1 is enough if it can open a homicide investigation per county
Everyone is waiting for lawyer commercialsîhave u been injured by a covid19 vaccine u may be eligible etcî
Well, we gotta do this now im not waiting for those guys
Is there a database of verified reports?  Vaers is intentionally designed to be shit evidence i think
So thats pretty much the final nail in the coffin i need for a pretty robust and bulletproof report and evidence package with instructions for citizen arrest(with evidence of crimes gathered in hand)
Essentially what sexton is doing in the uk but with an american twist
So yeah
Since my sexton case clone relies on there being local cases of death/injury we need to get organized and get victims a platform to legally identify themselves and testify what happened.
My case is a big one- i will post it when its finished, im not a lawyer but spent years as a case assistant building intellectual property cases.  So i spoonfed lawyers their logic and i did have one decision overturned by the EU commision.  Im just a concerned nobody but im pretty aware and the real proís will polish the case
In the meantime
If anyone in usa wants to give me a statement on injury with contact info to add to my case- along with any other documents, receipts, etc- doctors notes, i am looking for a magic number like 50
Plus i guess i should establish an email to submit to- and advertise for.
I could pay for advertising and get some keen volunteers to process and verify and catalogue submissions i think we could beat vaers in terms of weight of evidence
If interested comment below
I have a fat case im going to be sending out
Everything is more or less complete except this part- i need to prove the immediate threat by having local victims
Lets get it together- victim database - volunteer basis- i need help lets shut it down

Woke up and went to the GP, ECG was recommended, nothing unusual but a fast heart rate. I have read that around 92% of heart inflammation patients did not have any noticeable issues with an ECG. Doctor contacted a cardiologist and he recommended a blood test (for troponin, etc) if any chest pain, shortness of breath arises. 2 days later I have some light but uncomfortable pains when turning or breathing too heavily. Does anybody know if I have any chance of myo/pericarditis after just one dose and aspiration. And if so what should I do next (can't be bothered waiting 4-5 hours in ER over weekend)?

(Joint pain),https://www.reddit.com/r/covidvaccineinjury2/comments/s86prq/has_anyone_else_experienced_sudden_arthritislike/,covidvaccineinjury2,"23F. No family history of arthritis or anything like that. Received first dose of Pfizer and side-effects were pretty mild, just a fever for one day. Received a second shot exactly a month later- the side-effects were even milder, barely had a fever at all.
Then, a week later, both my hands started to ache. Initially I thought it might just be due to computer use, although it was strange because I wasn't using the computer heavily at all at the time and the pain was equal in both hands rather than worse in my dominant/mouse hand. I consulted with a physiotherapist after the pain didn't go away after a week and followed the advice to make my computer set-up more ergonomic. I even bought braces for my wrists to sleep in to make sure I wasn't bending them during the night.
A month later, my hands are still aching. Recently my wrists and knees have begun to hurt, too. I spoke to a doctor and I'm going to get bloodwork done soon to test for arthritis-related inflammation. I'm honestly scared shitless, and this is really affecting my mental health. What will my 40s look like if I already have pain like this in my early 20s? These types of conditions are degenerative and have no cure.
I can't say for certain its due to the vaccine, but the coincidence of the timing is too hard to ignore. I haven't been able to find any similar stories- it looks like most side effects are heart related- so I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar.",2022-01-20,7,POST

The biopsy shows no specific lupus band (a diagnostic tool too determine lupus in the skin) but the histology confirmes it.

~ I already have very bad heart palpitations as well as blackouts and doctors canít find the reason behind them;
~ I am a 19 year old girl and I really want to have children one day, I heard that fertility is concerned;
~ I am at risk of getting autoimmune disease, which runs in my family and the vaccine is said to have caused autoimmune diseases as well;
~ Is the booster even more dangerous?
Are there any women, who got vaccinated and got a child? How are you all coping with the side effects?
I definitely donít consider myself anti-vaxxer because I believe vaccines are essential, however I donít like the idea of getting one, which is made with almost no real life tests, which is still in experimental state, from which people are complaining that they got severe damage and they are being muted for speaking out. Are we going to get vaccinated every 6 months or even every 3?!

49,rsebd8,A study done in September shows there is no positive correlation between vaccines and and covid cases,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidvaccineinjury2/comments/rsebd8/a_study_done_in_september_shows_there_is_no/,covidvaccineinjury2,"What does this mean? It means the vaccines don't work to reduce the number of covid cases.
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/)
Vaccines currently are the primary mitigation strategy to combat COVID-19 around the world. For instance, the narrative related to the ongoing surge of new cases in the United States (US) is argued to be driven by areas with low vaccination rates \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/#CR1)\]. A†similar narrative also has been observed in countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom \[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/#CR2)\]. At the same time, Israel that was hailed for its swift and high rates of vaccination has also seen a substantial resurgence in COVID-19 cases \[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/#CR3)\]. We investigate the relationship between the percentage of population† fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases across 68 countries and across 2947 counties in†the US.
## Findings
**At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of†population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7†days** (Fig.†[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/figure/Fig1/)). In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of†population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. Notably, Israel with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7†days. The lack of a meaningful association between percentage population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases is further exemplified, for instance, by comparison of Iceland and Portugal. Both countries have over 75% of their population fully vaccinated and have more COVID-19 cases per 1 million people than countries such as Vietnam and South Africa that have around 10% of their population fully vaccinated.",2021-12-31,11,POST

To investigate whether there is a connection between the COVID-19 shots and various bleeding disorders, the National Institute of Public Health (FHI) is now conducting a large study among more than 60,000 girls and women aged 12-80 in Norway. So far, preliminary results for the 6,000 women representing the 18-30 age bracket have been published.
ìWe see in this study that a number of women experienced various disorders after the first or second dose of the COVID vaccineî, project manager FHI doctor Lill Trogstad said in a press release.
Based on the preliminary results, FHI listed a number of tips for women who have experienced menstrual disorders, including postponing further vaccination until the cause has been investigated or the symptoms have passed.
Among the participants, 59.4 percent received Pfizer as the first dose, whereas 35.8 percent received Moderna, 4.7 percent AstraZeneca, and 0.2 percent Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). For dose two, 47.4 percent received Pfizer and and 52.6 percent Moderna.
In the summer of 2021, women across the world began to report bleeding disorders after receiving a vaccine against coronavirus. In Denmark alone, their figure soared from several dozen to over a thousand in a matter of several weeks. By November, the number of reports exceeded 3,900. Norway, however, became the first nation to respond with a broad population survey, after having processed only 1,264 reports.",2021-12-31,5,POST

But I know something is off these symptoms are foreign. They are getting better as time goes on but no one in my life will even entertain the idea of it being vaccine injury..prior to these symptoms Iíve trusted ìscienceî tooth and nail...I started doing my own research, and slowly but surely becoming someone that doesnít reflect my mindset historically. 
Iím anxious, scared, and unbelievably angry. I did the thing that they wanted us to do and now my body is glitching out.

Period. It's a man-made abomination synthesized from computer models that invades your body's OWN CELLS and changes THEIR DNA so they will start to produce spike proteins.We have no idea what this will do, or cause.
1.) It killed almost every animal it was tested on. It's caused such a backlog in the VAERS system that they'll never recover (100's of thousands of records backlogged).
2.) It's already killed thousands that we know of, but my estimate is that the numbers are far higher, in the 100's of thousands.
3.) It's maimed hundreds of thousands that we know of. Permanently. People that will have to spend $50K a month for the rest of their lives just to stay alive. Most of THOSE will be dead within 10. Again, real numbers are likely much higher, in the millions.
4.) It provably provides NO immunity.
5.) It's a ""leaky"" treatment. (I can't in good conscience call it a ""vaccine""). Meaning BECAUSE it does not provide immunity, it's likely to create mutations.
6.) We know it causes myocarditis - a lifelong auto-immune disorder that ends in death of 40% within 5 years. 76% at 10. There's no such thing as ""mild"" myocarditis. It ALWAYS gets worse over time BECAUSE it's an auto-immune disease. The younger you get it, the shorter your life will be. Period.
7.) We know it causes strokes.
8.) We know it causes heart attacks.
9.) We know it causes auto-immune disorders.
10.) We know it causes a whole SLEW of diseases. 9 pages of typed diseases by Pfizer's own study.
11.) We know it causes death. Pfizer knew it causes death. The FDA knew it causes death. And at a higher rate than Covid itself. It's literally an experimental injection where the only ""good"" it provides AT ALL is the money it makes for the pharmaceutical companies that make it, and the congress people that invested in it EVERYTHING ELSE it does is negative. In many cases, even lethal.
Then there's the long-term effects. We could be looking at a global sterilization. If the vaccine causes pregnant women to abort, what does it do, permanently, to a woman's ability to conceive? We don't know because it was never tested.
All so the elites could get richer, we could be looking at a global depopulation in 30 years. But the elites don't care, because they'll be dead by then, and I'm certain that they made sure their own families ""accidentally"" got the saline injections.

I recently found an article from 2007 regarding a pseudo-whooping cough epidemic that was caused by flawed RT-PCR testing.
Is it possible that such a test could this have led to inflated Covid CFR and IFR?
Due to the fact that PCR is currently the gold standard for the quick testing diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 as apposed to the isolation method of which prior to Sars-CoV-2 was considered the gold standard for all viral infection testing. Could the Covid pandemic have seen inflated case rates as seen in the article attached?

91,r1r6fv,Side effects after Pfizer,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidvaccineinjury2/comments/r1r6fv/side_effects_after_pfizer/,covidvaccineinjury2,"My boyfriend (31) received Pfizer on 11/3, and he has been sick ever since.
The immediate side effect was excessively sweating and fainting as soon as the vaccine was injected into his arm. 
He developed symptoms such as headache, brain fogginess, severe diarrhea, then, three days later, he had to go to the emergency room as he developed even more severe symptoms such as paralysis in his face, head, ear, and his left arm. 
The doctors did ECG, prescribing him Tylenol, Ibuprofen. As soon as the school health center opened on weekdays, he saw a primary doctor. The doctor ordered the d-dimer test to detect any micro blood clots, which turned out negative.  She gave my boyfriend a referral to Allergist. 
The appointment with the allergist is in January, and he is having miserable times while waiting for the appointment. 
His numbness has been released yet his brain fog and headache make him still extremely uncomfortable, and he develops anxiety attacks and nose bleedings as other Covid vaccine side effects. As his girlfriend, I have tried to reach out to the neurologist, yet they do not accept a new patient but only a referral. The doctor and nurse's attitude only makes us more frustrated as they assume he's trying to get a medical exemption from the covid vaccine mandate. 
In my opinion, he needs to be sent to a neurologist, not an allergist, and his symptoms should be taken more seriously, and diagnosed more properly. 
Watching my boyfriend suffering makes me extremely sad and painful. He is one of the healthiest people I have ever seen, and I cannot even describe my emotion watching him suffer, helpless, and anxious. I have been crying every night, feeling like walking on an eggshell. 
I was able to talk to only a few people around me since the majority of people around me don't believe the side effects from the covid vaccine. 
If there is any medical profession here, could you give me any advice/comment/your thoughts, please?
Also, could you share your experience if you go/went through a similar situation to us? Specifically, nose bleeding is a new symptom of his, so please share your advice with me if you are going/went through this.

On Oct 7, I got my 2 Pfizer shot.  A few days later, I started getting major heart palpitations.
I had an EKG, Chest X-ray, wore a heart monitor for a week and got blood tested for a potential thyroid problem and everything tested fine. ThenÖ I had a wild panic/anxiety attack. Now Iím constantly anxious over nothing and Iím on daily drugs and have a stronger prescription if I start escalating again. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.
What the heck! This is all within 7-10 days after the 2nd shot. Doctors wonít listen to me and donít acknowledge that itís related to the vaccine, they just move along with treatment plan.
Has anyone else experienced this?!?
Edit: how can we bring more awareness to this? Iíve reported it here: https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index.jsp
Everything I see on vaccine side effects is heart related or blood clots. However, Iím finding many people suffering from anxiety after the shot. Two days ago, I told my story to a friend and she dealt with bad anxiety after the first shot and is not going to take the second. She hasnít seen a doctor but there are too many people suffering and not enough attention to it! My story helped her but how many others are too embarrassed or quiet to share?!? They probably think something is wrong with them like we all did but there are too many examples for this to be a coincidence.

Immediately after my shot i experienced tingling in both legs and a burning sensation. The tingling is still the same, i can best describe it as a constant buzzing, sometimes its worse or sometimes better, but it is always present.
The burning sensation comes and goes.
The sideeffects are only in my legs.
I havent seen a doc, because Ive read some have dealt with the same and got no result after numerous tests
But now the booster shot is slowly approaching and i am not sure if i want it. I really want to make sure that this dont get worse, i am 99% sure its the vacc, because i havent dealt with this before.

My 72 year old mother had COVID early on March 2020.
She was very pro vaccine when it came out.
She does ballet 3 days a week and yoga twice. She walks 10k steps a day. 110lbs. She has no medical conditions and is on no medications. The is one of the healthiest people I know. Her blood pressure has been 120/60 for the past 30 years. 
1st dose (May 21) - she said was very similar to having COVID just shorter.
2nd dose (June 21) - 40 minutes after the shot she started getting dizzy.
She has been dizzy and has had blurred vision since then. A few weeks ago took her blood pressure and it was 170/90.
She finally told me about it a few days ago and I took her to the ER with a 213/96 blood pressure. 
CT scan and MRI negative. 
Blood tests show no infection or anything unusual
Urine sample shows nothing unusual
Chest xray shows nothing 
They gave her a med to lower her pressure and her vision started to become clearer a bit and headache started to subside a bit. Discharged. They said she had white coat syndrome. 
But a day later and things are getting back to where they were before. 
Does anyone know a doctor that has treated something like this? Any recommendations of what to tell our doctor next?
It has been constant for 5 months now. Her right eye is pretty much blurry all the time. She says she feels like she's floating on a cloud when she walks (the room is not spinning type of dizzy)",2021-11-03,9,POST

This went on ever since - I lost 9lbs in 2 weeks which is real odd for me .every time I worked out , difficult breathing- and full blown panic would ensue. I did numerous blood draws, wore a holter monitor , still no answers . I have POTS that must of been aggravated , but oddly my endo found that I developed LADA - which is type 1.5 diabetes .

I have thyroid issues , and thatís about it . My doctors believe o had an autoimmune attack on my pancreas post vaccine , and possibly some neuro issues - I get foggy thinking and memory problems - also sometimes get numb in the face and fingers which scares me- my eyesight also worsened - Oh and I skipped my period for 2 months - I always have regular periods - just all whacked out - Iím 48 , 5î5 110 lbs - otherwise was healthy .

After the injection, I immediately noticed chest pain, and later that day I started to experience flu like symptoms (to be expected and resolved quickly), as well as a weird wave of euphoria - almost felt like an endorphin release. 
On day 2 I began having horrible, unrelenting, intrusive thoughts, OCD, and finally a massive panic attack which resulted in me collapsing in the shower and being taken to the ER in an ambulance since I thought I was having a heart attack. Note that NOTHING like this has ever happened to me before getting the J&J vaccine. Since that day, the anxiety I continue to feel is almost beyond belief - if feels like I'm getting IV injections of caffeine every 20 minutes, like the most massive adrenaline fight or flight feeling, along with a rapid heart rate (yesterday my heart rate shot up to 164). I've been cleared by my primary care physician, a cardiologist, and a neurologist at this point and everyone just says ""it's anxiety, take xanax"".....which I've done every single day since August 29th and would like to stop since it is highly addictive, causes memory issues and makes me feel like a zombie. But if I try to stop the xanax at all, the panic skyrockets again along with an erratic hear rate. 
At this point it is truly ruining my life. I haven't worked in over a week, I can barely do anything because I'm paralyzed in panic and don't want to go anywhere or talk to friends/family and it's gotten to the point where I fear it's damaging my relationship with my boyfriend.

However I'm military and they made it mandatory so I went ahead and got the vaccine... ever since we have been down to 1 to 2 times a week. Also I've noticed that when I masturbate it doesnt feel the same. Like the feeling is dull, less sensation. Also I dont get aroused as often or as easy. Normally I would get an erection 3 to 4 times a day, now I can go a few days without getting an erection and now that I am not as active sexually mu wife is starting to be the one that initiates and is upset with how much stimulation it takes to get ne aroused. When seeing her naked used to be enough now it takes a blow job or hand job to get me up. I can still perform as usual its just the desire is gone, almost like it's a passive thing to do rather than something I need. Is anyone else dealing with something similar?",2021-10-06,14,POST

height - 5ft 2
Weight - 52kg
Normal periods last 5/6 days and cycles were always between 22 - 27 days long.
Side effects from 1st dose (14th May 2021) - didnít really feel any different physically apart from small sharp pains in left hand side of my chest and a little tired that evening. Didnít really experience it again apart from that. Had a little brain fog at times in work. Menstrual cycles still came as normal and same in consistency in length but looking back I was experiencing bad PMS cramps before and at the beginning of the bleeding. The last period I had before the 2nd dose I had a little spotting lasting 1 day 2 days after the period ended. 
Side effects from 2nd dose (9th August 2021) - had a very adverse reaction this time, never regretted something so much in my life I felt like Iíd been poisoned. Felt groggy and fatigued not long after and the night after was feeling really tired but couldnít sleep as I was developing night sweats followed by a weird tingling/burning sensation on my skin especially my arms and legs. For the next 3 weeks I couldnít leave my bed, loss of appetite, hot flashes, constantly tired and wanting to sleep all the time, brain fog, joint pain, being sick, no energy to do any physical activity, constantly low mood, diarrhoea, loss of sex drive and lost feeling in the nether regions in general and have lost sensitivity when I need to pee. My period came as expected but it was much lighter and darker lasting 6 days experiencing cramps and severe lower back pain like my organs were being ripped out and they continued for another 2 weeks after the period stopped, my stomach was still swollen really badly which never happens then had bleeding again so had a 15 day cycle lasting 6 days and swelling went down once that bleed finished which was slightly more like a normal period to my usual. 22 days later I had another period which was still a bit lighter than usual, at first it was dark blood which became brighter red that same day then changing to the average colour the day after and at the end became dark and stringy then light spotting. So Iím thinking my period is reregulating to itís normal cycle even though the bleeding is still a bit different. 
Iíve had hormone tests done and seen gynae twice and everything came back normal. Iím still not feeling the same several weeks on even though I have improved from the first 3 weeks post 2nd dose. Iím still experiencing some hot flashes, ovarian/womb pain, aches near the groin, constant fatigue, no motivation, no energy, brain fog, low mood and feel like a zombie, still not much sensation when I need to pee so Iím worried this is related to some nerve damage that Iím unsure is permanent or temporary or whether it is hormone related and still no sex drive when it used to be high prior to all this. Itís really affected my work life and everyday life I donít feel like the same person I once was and this is physically and mentally the most challenging thing Iíve ever gone through and I feel so alone. I understand many people are experiencing the same as me and that a lot of doctors donít seem to know whatís going on as long these ëvaccinesí were rushed out and have no long term studies on them. Work pressured me to get the first, originally I outright refused J&J and AstraZeneca because it was well known then that they were causing blood clots in younger women and Pfizer then became available which at the time I thought was ësafeí as my parents and a few friends had it not experiencing any side effects unlike myself. All of them are equally as bad and dangerous as Iíve realised. I didnít want to get the 2nd dose as was already hearing horror stories and Iím mad at myself for giving in to that never mind the 1st but my parents pressured me into it and said I need it for travelling with my job when I donít as I could refuse and wasnít mandatory but did it anyway as Iím an idiot. I feel cheated as life has pretty much gone back to normal a few weeks ago given the lowered restrictions and Iíve risked my health for the sake of a virus I never caught and would most likely have less long lasting adverse reactions unlike the vaccine. 
I know other people have experienced or are experiencing the same or worse reactions than myself but the way Iím still feeling mentally and physically is getting me down and I want to know if anyone knows what I can do in the meantime medication/supplement/diet wise to speed up the process of feeling like the old me again? And if anyone else experiencing/has experienced what I have has improved or fully recovered? As I donít know how long this will last and itís really affected my life and Iím not used to feeling unwell for the the extended period of time that I have so far",2021-09-30,17,POST

April 27 first AstraZeneca shot
May 27 first sign of issues - heart palpitations
July 6 - CT scan comes back with a bilateral pulmonary embolism 
Today - palpitations continue. 
Never had COVID or any symptoms 
No genetic or blood related clotting risk factors
No general risk factors
No underlying conditions. 
COVID antibody test showed none, meaning I didnít get COVID (even with no symptoms)
40 (at the time), fit, healthy. 
Now, 4 months later my palpitations are still happening. Iíve been on blood thinners since July and my clots should be clear by now. I also suffered terrible insomnia, enough to almost drive me literally insane. 
Today I continue to have palpitations and I donít know what to do. My Apple Watch is constantly calling out atrial fibrillation when I use the ecg feature. In June/July it would capture the extra palpitations but would rarely call them atrial fibrillation. My gut feeling is that my heart is slowly degenerating. I just donít know how to prove it. 
I do have another holter coming up. I had a holter and echocardiogram in late July and they were ìnormalî. 
This has been a nightmare and I would never do it again. I will not get another shot and will not allow my little kids to get it.

First dose vaccine give on 28th August in right upper arm.
- within 30 seconds deep inner ear canal pain right ear only.
- ear pain intensifies for an hour hitting a 9/10 pain scale.
- right side face goes stiff and semi paralysed for about an hour post shot, started after 20 minute observation window.
- headaches and normal symptoms thereafter, ear and face normal.
- ten days later, have had headaches most days although mild enough to ignore at most times.
- tenth day sitting on couch, heart pain, palpitations and loss of breath, continues for hours, end up in hospital for tests, discharged as not being under threat of cardiac event, no explanation reached.
- 12th day back in hospital with the same.
- 15th day heart pain consistent every day, comes and goes but 0.5-1/10 pain.
-15th night, wake in sleep from chronic inner ear canal pain right side. Go back to sleep after goes away.
-16th day after shot, inner ear canal feels strange, pain comes and goes in surges throughout day. Surging ear pain comes and goes over next 5 days.
- Today, no more ear symptoms but heart pain is a daily thing now, very regular but no palpitations or breathing issues. Occasionally chest pain across whole diaphragm in between heart pain, very mild but uncomfortable.
No previous history of heart pain
No previous history of damage to ear
No history of breathing or lung issues
Doctors - checked for myocarditis, ECG done, bloods done, x-ray of chest done. No conclusion.

Anyone with similar symptoms? I donít know what to think. I suffered an adverse reaction to an SSRI 3 years ago, leaving me with mostly the symptom of severe insomnia, but I had been doing so much better with my sleep over the last year or so. But these symptoms after the Moderna vax are brand new for me. I donít dare tell any friends because they already know about my SSRI reaction and probably donít even believe it. Theyíll think Iím a hypochondriac or making things up Iím sure. Anyways..
After the first moderna vax, my arm felt as though Iíd dislocated my shoulder. The pain was severe and although it subsided significantly within three days, mild pain continued for another month. I felt like crap for two days, but no biggie. After a week I noticed bier spots on my arms and thought that was a bit strange,   but didnít give it much thought. Around the same time I developed an itchy nighttime bumpy rash. Like all the hair follicles were inflamed it seemed. The rash subsided late morning every day. After about 3 weeks the rash became less intense. 
I had 3 episodes of rib cage pain that I couldnít put my finger on. The pain surrounds the entire rib cage, front and back. The first episode lasted 4 days and the other two episodes were much more mild lasting just a day or so. It felt like the muscles or tissue between the ribs were inflamed.
I went ahead and got the second vax. Had the flu like symptoms for two days. The rash came back full force. Two weeks later I noticed the bier spots became far more consistent. I suffer from fatigue already, but the fatigue intensified. I decided to take my blood pressure and heart rate while sitting and standing. My heart rate is normal sitting  (60s) but shoots up to over 100 within minutes of standing. Every single time. I get lightheaded, dizzy, and so very tired throughout the day. I also noticed that when Iíd scratch myself lightly the skin on my body either became very red and inflamed, as though Iíd rly dug in when I hadnít and remained there for over a day! I also developed little pin point blood spots (petechia) under my arms and when lightly scratched on sensitive areas of the skin, (inner thigh, breast, stomach). My labs were drawn and my blood work came back normal. Around the two week mark, I developed a sunburn sensation on my skin (mostly my arms and back and lower legs) despite nothing being visibly wrong with them. It comes and goes,  but is mostly always there on my arms. The rib cage pain has become a daily occurrence now. The pain migrates around the rib cage. Sometimes I feel the pain in the front, sometimes on one side, sometimes, in the back or all over. 
I believe based on my heart rate pattern upon standing and the dizziness and lightheadedness Iíve  developed POTs. I have a cardiologist appt in several weeks to confirm and will report back.
Iím now about 4 weeks out from my last vax and Iíve gone two nights now without the rash and without the inflamed skin from gentle scratching. Iím afraid these other symptoms may be lasting.

26F, fit and healthy before.
I got the Moderna Covid Vaxx back in January for work. I would have been fired if I hadn't. I got sick from it, and was fired for getting sick. 
Seven months and counting!
I'm having debilitating fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, vision disturbances, and tinnitus, among other things. 
I had chest pain for months, culminating in July with crushing chest pain, Left sided jaw pain, pallor/dizziness, extreme shortness of breath, fullness in chest, sharp radiating shoulder pain, etc. Sound like a heart attack? Yeah, I thought so too, but three different doctors REFUSED to test me because: ""The Vaxx doesn't do that, so there's no point looking."" Thankfully, I got on Propranolol and the chest pain eased. 
That said! Seven months in, I still have debilitating fatigue, shortness of breath, and brain fog. 
I can't get a job, got turned down for unemployment (for getting fired), food stamps, government insurance, etc. Thankfully, my parents let me move back in.

My degree is in molecular biology and I definitely had a lot of reservations about getting this vaccine, which is incredibly frustrating when people automatically assume the hesitancy is due to a lack of understanding regarding immunology and mRNA- when in reality it's what I study! Gah, haha. Since when did 'trusting the science' change to mean trusting the television? 
Regarding the point of mRNA having no 'off-switch', mRNA has a very short life-span. It's broken down fairly quickly by enzymes once inside the cell. But the fact that the public is being told that the spike protein translated from the mRNA is harmless is truly negligent in my opinion. That along with the migration of the LNPs throughout the body was what made me really worried, and clearly for good reason :( I'm at the point where I just hope I haven't done any irreversible damage with these two shots, and that these symptoms will fade over time like they have for some others. It's encouraging to read that you're doing better! How was your response to the covid vaccine (if you took it)? Funnily enough I never got my HPV shot when I was younger because my mom was nervous since it was so new, and I was going to get it soon under my gynecologists' recommendation, but I think I'll be holding off on that one too for now, given my body's reaction to the covid vax.

???? Yeah they try to fudge the numbers around to make it seem ""rare"".. but 1:100000 is not rare... That's actually really common.. 
That would mean of 335m you'd have 3,350 people with that reaction.. however at 5:250000, it's now 1:50000, which means that it's now 6'700 people that is affected...
But since they're saying ""oh that isn't related"" to keep the condition ""rare""... It's all bullshit.
They lie for power.. lie to continue to scare the population...
Plus they continuously release news reports...
""Expect even more variants than Omicron!""
There are going to be as many variants as they choose to keep the population gullible, scared, and divided.

Based on what I've been hearing (from those who have tried to obtain an exemption as well as those who work in healthcare) it's extremely difficult to obtain a medical exemption and  healthcare providers are being told by their superiors not to write them under any circumstances.  I did not have any medical issues before I had a vaccine reaction, so all the medical providers I saw were new to me. Maybe if someone had long-term doctors who knew them and their medical situation, that might help?  I decided to apply for a religious exemption instead and it was approved. Neither I nor my religion is opposed to vaccines in general, or even to this vaccine.  The basis of my request was that my religion prohibits knowingly causing harm to one's health, and based on my prior reaction, taking an additional dose would be causing harm.

I am so sorry for what you have been going through from the v.
The initial symptoms my bf got were body paralysis then it lead to severe headaches and brain fogginess. Now he has heart palpitations and random anxiety attacks that come irregularly... 
I heard about how antihistamine treatment/diet can help, but we haven't tried it yet. 
For me, I have mild symptoms such as shortness of breath, arrhythmia, fatigue, vertigo, bad PMS and menstrual symptoms.
We both tried fish oils, multivitamins and vitamin D, but then we decided to stop all...I read that boosting the immune system could worsen the symptoms, and we felt like vitamin D triggered some symptoms. I honestly don't know...just feel lost.
He is even hesitant to visit doctors, because of their denial and gaslight manipulation of our v injury.
I am getting more convinced that histamine triggers the symptoms for sure because my bf and I tend to develop similar symptoms after eating a certain food.
I just really hope we all eventually fully recover from this misery... ??
Thanks so much and prayer for you!",2022-01-23,2,COMMENT

So, in my humble opinion, NO ONE gets away from this with no damage. The cells are being torn apart, literally, as is the DNA. I can't link the vimeo video for some reason, it is called ""distrbing alegatons from Dr. Andras nack"" (again misspellings all intentional).

Called my primary see doc (who refused to write me a doc note so that I could keep my job, even though she knew I had several I autoimmune issues, and POTs which is neurological.) She suggested I speak to an allergist and neurologist, I was panicked. 
I had a neurologist and told them it was an emergency, so he saw me. He said they are just now seeing things bubble up with the vaccine and he did not think it was a good idea that people keep getting shot after shot. Heís sending me for an MRI, but I bet it will come back normal, based on what so many others have said. (Itís remarkable how all these stories are now the same.)
Thanks to this group, Iím gonna check for  blood clots. ??
Iím also with a cardiologist (echocardiogram last week) and will do a holter monitor next week, & am meeting an allergist on Monday. 
Iím now seeing 5 doctors for one shot and worried that this ìnumb/tinglingî has not gone away. Praying itís not MS, as when you search that topic with Pfizer, some women in trials developed MS as a result; Guilin-Barr is also an issue for some... Wtf?
Here is what my research is telling me, there is something ìallergic ì happening here, and something neurological. The shot is impacting our  Central Nervous System and Covid is known to also cause PTSD and anxiety. (So, you are not crazy, this vaccine is crossing the blood brain barrier and literally causing PTSD/anxiety by impacting the brain steam. Something PHYSICAL is happening to you, not metal.) Iím now on an antihistamine that also treats anxiety called Hydroxyzine. Itís helped calm me, but Iím not sleeping well, primarily due to the nerve issues that are constant, zero relief and just moves around my body , with temperature issues, Iím either hot or cold. (One girl in a group described it like ìicy/hot was rubbed all over her bodyî; thatís me.)
Also in the podcast below you will hear that Covid impacts nerves (like when you lose your taste and sense  smell). Covid hides in the brain, and is causing these issues.
Report everything to VAERS, or force your doctors to.
Iím currently listening to this podcast & they take you through how Covid impacts the body, and the same thing can be said for the reactions we are having to the shot. Basically whatís happening to us is ìlong Covidî:

This is also a good podcast that explains how the virus works on the body, it needs a place to live/replicateÖyour cells. This shot is causing a cytokine storm in our body and our immune systems are struggling:

Iím looking into ozone and peptides now to see if I can reverse the effects of this shot. Iíve seen others post that theyíve been dealing with this for months.
Sending you all the best.",2022-02-02,3,COMMENT

I just had some tests done with cardiologist and they say Iím fine and wonít write me exemption due to CDC guidelines.

BP up and down and heart palpitations and weaknesss and fatigue. Since the start of symptoms I have had an ER visit, several cardiologist and primary visits,  and so much blood work and tests- the only thing that showed that was way out of normal and in toxic high levels were toxic high levels b vitamins- B3, B6 and B12. Itís been a month since I stopped all supplements and am having some relief. Symptoms are still there but more intermittent and less intense. They are the worst in the morning and I still have palpitations at waking. All docs except my primary concluded it was anxiety. Iím glad she kept looking.

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing your experience-a lot of people are experiencing this and havenít yet put two and two together. I saw my Dr. for a follow up on Monday, all seemed well. I seemed to be improving (A BIT) with PT and Lyrica. ThenÖlast night I was in excruciating pain. My whole body was burning,my back and shoulders hurt. I called my Dr. and he called in pain meds/muscle relaxer. It relieved some pain but I still feel like now I took ten steps back. When I go two full weeks without one of these flair ups, I will consider it progress.
I broached the subject with my Dr. about the vaccine. He didnít seem too forthcoming that these symptoms  could be linked but he also didnít completely dismiss me which was a relief as well! I see him again in two month, will continue the Lyrica and PT. I honestly donít know what else these symptoms could be linked to. For now he diagnosed me with ìviral neuritisî. 
Iím sorry your also going through this, itís really frustrating and painful. Please will you keep me updated on your progress as well?

I started doing cold plunges a few weeks ago and it has helped improve the intensity and frequency of the palpitations. Give that a try if you can. Get good sleep, make sure your diet is optimal and stay away from caffeine. Get some regular exercise but donít over do it. Even a daily walk is good. 
Of course regular consultation with your doctor. Keep advocating for yourself. Most people and doctors will brush it off.

If youíre a man(especially a young man) the J&J one is the safest because your higher metabolism would make the mrna vaccines potentially attack your heart. The spike protein could get into your heart muscles due to increased metabolism. Blood clots is an admitted problem for this one, but if you take blood thinners or eat a good bit of natural blood thinning foods you should be fine.
If youíre a woman the Pfizer vaccine is probably your safest option because it has a lot less mrna than the Moderna, and the J&J comes with an increased risk of brain blood clots in women. mRNA vaccines are less risky in women due to different metabolism speed making it less likely spike proteins can get into the heart from what I can gather.",2022-01-23,5,COMMENT

You can check out Dr. Bruce Pattersonís work. He is treating long haulers and vax reactions based on a cytokine panel. You can register through their website. 
https://covidlonghaulers.com
The other idea is to check to see if you have small fiber neuropathy as many with vax reactions and covid long haulers are finding they do. This can often be the reason for POTs and sometimes the SFN is autoimmune mediated. Check out celltrends testing for POTs and autoantibodies. Itís often an autoimmune issue 
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.013602
Celltrend is a lab in Germany you can send your blood off too. 
https://www.celltrend.de/en/pots-cfs-me-sfn/
Also check out the Washington University panel and their sensory panel for Small fiber neuropathy

Additionally, itís been shown that autoantibodies against G protein coupled receptors cause POTs in Long covid. I know you donít have long covid but all our symptoms mirror long haul covid and people doing the testing are finding the same autoantibodies and cytokine profile as in long haul covid. 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909021000204?fbclid=IwAR2mWG-yHyrXQrZqvA4A_gwsAu4q-OZKf0lPCW5TpTHkSjXlUzCutdmqF0k
The issue is getting a doctor to order these tests. Iím not sure if the G protein autoantibody test is even publicly available right now. The others you could order out of pocket gi your doctor wonít. If you DO have autoantibodies then you have a strong case for getting IVIG approved for treatment through insurance.",2022-01-22,1,COMMENT

Plus I already had covid last year and I was sick for 2 months with long covid. I am incredibly anxious about getting covid again so I think having a vaccine that prevents bad symptoms wouldnít be so bad. 
Now Iím thinking about Johnson & Johnson vaccine bc itís just one dose and Iím really anxious about needles plus Iím moving to university (in another country) next week so I wanted to get the vaccine before I leave and I guess I wouldnít be able to go back home for my 2nd dose anyway. 
I was then thinking of getting Moderna booster after a couple months. 
However Iíve read some articles saying that J&J can cause blood cloths in women so Iím pretty worried about that. I was wondering if anyone knows, was there anything else those women had in common other than being a woman? Like using birth control, being obese or having diabetes or something like that? Would it be maybe ok to get J&J vaccine if I took aspirin for a couple weeks afterwards? 
I know some people are probably gonna recommend Pfizer but I really donít want Pfizer since I know 2 people personally who had incredibly bad side effects after the shot (the reason why I didnít want to get vaccinated in the first place). So Iím really scared of Pfizer plus I find it kinda weird that media is ignoring all these side effects Pfizer has (like heart issues) but always pointing out J&J bad side effects. Like whyÖ 
Either way, can anyone please help me decide what to do?",2022-01-20,3,POST

One is that we give a 3rd dose to immunocompromised individuals and we give boosters to non-immunocompromised individuals - but that doesn't actually explain the difference  
The second is that one is more of a top up whilst the other is more of a booster...which is the most unhelpful distinction I've ever seen. So one adds more while the other increases - what does it mean?
So my questions are  
1. can any vaccine be used as a booster or a 3rd dose? (i.e. can AZ be administered as both a booster and a 3rd dose, and pfizer and moderna etc etc)  
2. Is there a difference in the make up (ingredients/concentrations) between a booster and a 3rd dose?  
3. Is one better than the other and if it is, why aren't all people being offered that instead of only one group?  
4. When people talk about a 12 week period of immunity or needing a new jab every 3 months or regular jabs (the way we do with flu jabs), will they be boosters or 4th/5th/6th etc doses.  
5. Can you have a booster and then (however long after) get a 3rd dose? Or get the 3rd dose and later get a booster?
6. Are there any other key differences that wouldn't have been covered by the answers to my more specific questions?
Thank you in advance for any labour put in to helping me understand.

31,r8jewq,Moderna shot experience and worries about booster,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/r8jewq/moderna_shot_experience_and_worries_about_booster/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"For context Iím a college age student with no serious issues that would compromise my immune system. 
Iím putting this out there to share my experience of getting the Moderna covid vaccine. I got mine around late March/ early April of this year and had some interesting stories to come out of it. I thought my reactions werenít that abnormal until I started telling people about what happened. 
The first shot for me was pretty fine. I had feverish symptoms for about an hour, took a nap, they were gone and I felt fine. 
The second shot howeverÖ.. 
I got it in the morning, around 11am and felt perfectly fine pretty much the entire day. My arm didnít even hurt that bad at all. Then nighttime came. Around 11:30 I started feeling very out of it and tired and so I went to get ready for bed. When getting ready for bed I started having a really bad fever and ended up falling asleep that way. I woke up that night around 4:30 and was really confused as to why I was awake out of nowhere. Well Iím glad my body woke me up because when I got out of bed to go grab some water I stood up and my vision went dark and I almost passed out. Thankfully I caught myself on my desk and sat down to drink my water. From there I felt really really sick and stumbled to my bathroom. I threw up 3 times and then kept dry heaving afterwards for about 10 minutes on and off. Eventually I tried standing up again and felt very lightheaded and went to stumble down my dorms hallway to get more water. After drinking some more water I felt a bit less lightheaded and went back to bed. The next day I had a horrible headache and still had a fever most of the day. The day after that however I felt completely fine. No arm soreness, no headache, nothing. 
Either way, even with saying this I completely think everyone should get the vaccine if you can as it has been proven to help and even with the side effects I experienced I would still do it again, in fact Iím getting my booster tmmrw and am a bit nervous but I know I will be ok. Feel free to ask questions if you have any or let me know what side effects you experienced if you also got moderna",2021-12-04,6,POST

I was diagnosed with very mild myocarditis a few hours later and it is believed I got it from my second moderna shot. I am curious if anyone else here has had this outcome? And also have any of you fully recovered? 
Iím unsure if my myocarditis has healed or not but I will say I donít have chest pains, though I am still being medicated with colchicine 0.6 MG 2 times a day. Cardiology has been keeping tabs on me and Iíve had several EKGs, 1 ECHO and even a recent chest X-ray. All of which came back ìperfectly normalî. I should also add that I work in construction and have consistently exerted myself heavily and have had no problems whatsoever with doing that. My concern is that some nights when I try to sleep I feel ìdancingî or ìflutteringî in my chest and sometimes as if my heart is beating irregularly. Anxiety has caused this for me when I was younger but ever since the second moderna shot Iím having it happen seemingly out of the blue and fairly often. I am almost certain it is anxiety, but thereís still part of me that thinks it could be linked to myocarditis. I also feel like my body, especially my legs, gets pretty cold when this happens and there have been instances where Iím shaking as if Iím freezing (that last part has only happened twice).

45,qv0zbf,Booster Shot Timing,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/qv0zbf/booster_shot_timing/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"I'm 20 M, and I got my second dose of Pfizer on 4/19/21.  While I plan to get a booster shot at some point, I'm wondering when to do it.  
First and foremost, I'm concerned that if I go get it now, I won't be able to immediately get the new booster shot Pfizer's working on that specifically targets Delta.  Even if a new strain is dominant at that point, it will be better prepared to combat future strains, as it will be more advanced.
Second, I know the timing with booster shots is important.  If I get them too early, my immune system might not have as significant of a response, resulting in less immunity than I could have received if I'd waited. 
Finally, I'm worried that if I don't get it soon enough after the first two, it will not work as well.  I'm not sure if they build on eachother or if it's just another dose because the previous one is wearing off. 
I know the CDC recommends them for those aged 18 to 64 who are at high risk for COVID due to where they work or reside, but I'm skeptical of that ruling because the CDC's Executive Board voted 6 in favor and 9 against, but the [CDC director recommended it anyway.](https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/07/cdc-director-defends-decision-to-overrule-expert-panel-on-covid-booster-shots-for-health-workers/)  I'm sure she's very smart, but I find it hard to believe that any one person is smarter than three of the brightest people in the country.

I'm not sure what I should do in this sort of situation, as they wouldn't let me (or my other siblings) get the vaccine even if I were to approach them about it.

Now they are saying we will need a booster shot soon and Iím terrified I donít want to be in anymore pain.

Ultimately, the decision to get the vaccine was not bc I believe it is all that effective but, because of the limitations for those unvaccinated and the mandates which I really donít agree with. It all feels very wrong. I am due for the 2nd shot on October 26th and I am extremely anxious about it to the point that I am not sure if I am going to even go to the appointment.

Heís now home and says heís feeling back to his normal and hasnít been wearing his oxygen as much, which his doctor was pleased with his oxygen levels. He heads back to work Sunday so fingers crossed heís healthy! 
Anyways, like I said my family all tested positive and for the most part we all handled it pretty well. Mostly dealt with fatigue, coughs, and congested. (We all thought we had head colds at first.) The worst symptoms I had was: 1. I lost my sense of smell (itís not very strong in general, so it didnít really bother me), and 2. I rarely wanted to eat. 
The reason Iím asking about the vaccines is because my family has been extremely skeptical of them from the beginning (and I know that this is very common and people have heard it a lot) and Iíve read a ton of stuff that makes me even more anxious than I already am. My dads doctor highly recommended that he get vaccinated and he fully agrees now. 
I think weíve all decided to just bite the bullet and get vaccinated, but it still terrifies me. Iím really trying to be open minded and not just look at one sided information, but I feel like the damage has already been done from what Iíve already read and heard. What has your experiences with the vaccine been? Can you please give me some insight into helping ease my anxieties??

Last Friday we rented a bus for 27 people. This Sunday we found out one of the 27 tested positive for covid and since then the positives have just kept rolling in. 
Personally, (I know this is an unpopular opinion) I do not trust the vaccine just yet. I believe there has not been enough TIME to fully understand the effects of this new form of vaccine. 
Of the 27 people - there were 6 unvaccinated and 21 vaccinated. As of today, 15 of the 21 vaccinated individuals are positive for covid. 2 of the 6 unvaccinated are positive. The other 4 unvaccinated (including me) have gotten negative tests and have had 0 symptoms. The 2 unvaccinated have a stuffy nose and thatís it. 11 of the people confirmed positive have very bad symptoms including fevers, body aches, chest pain, and nausea. 
Further interesting statistics in this case include that 3 of the 6 unvaccinated had covid within the last 8-12 months. Those 3 all negative. The only other 4 on the bus that had covid previously and were vaccinated all tested positive. 
Just thought this was very interesting to share, as it seems like those who had covid before and did not get the vaccine have the best protection.",2021-10-07,17,POST

98,p8dsku,Allergic reaction- Has anyone else experienced this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/p8dsku/allergic_reaction_has_anyone_else_experienced_this/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"
I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on August 11th. I have a severe allergy to bee venom. I also have an allergy to codeine. I was concerned about getting the vaccine because when vaccine first rollout began, they said no vaccine if you carry an epi pen. I did my research and decided Iíd go for it anyways. 
Well, prior to getting vaccine I ran my concerns by the nurse, and she basically shrugged it off as nonsense. About an hour after, I felt a little bit of discomfort in my throat but I shrugged it off. I went home, ate and took a nap. When I woke up I noticed I was beginning to get hives on my neck, I felt a tiny bit of pressure in my chest and trouble swallowing saliva. I STILL shrugged this off as I though I was maybe just being hyper aware of my body. I questioned myself over and over. I decided I was ok, went back to sleep and the next day I woke up at 4am with hives across my neck, more pressure in chest and same difficultly swallowing. I was so groggy, and completely out of it. I went back to sleep. After calling the nurse hotline later in the day, nurse confirmed I was having a reaction but I was told it had most likely stabilized since I had no new hives and I only felt a tiny bit of pressure in my chest at this point. She advised me to schedule a virtual visit or in person visit with a physician within three days. Because I live in the south, and the medical centers are overrun at the moment, I decided to schedule a virtual visit. Virtual visit doctor told me to go in person to be evaluated, which I did and the doctor basically confirmed again that I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and I would have to be cleared by an allergist for the second one. Vitals were ok by then, got sent home with cream for hives. 
Fast forward to day 8, I woke up in excruciating pain in upper neck and back and went to E.R. this time. I could barely turn my head. I was told by doctor I was having residual effects from the vaccine, and that Iíd have to basically ride it out. Doctor also told me I was the unlucky one to have a reaction as itís not common. I am still in pain, but since my vitals are ok I was just told to take pain meds and was sent home:( 
Has anyone else had this happen? I am on day nine, neck and back still hurt badly. 
I have no insurance and I am going to have to take another trip to E.R. in a day if my pain does not go away, hopefully I can get an M.R.I. and C.T.

105,p51iux,Looking for an intellectual conversation/philosophical take on covid? Here's my take...,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/p51iux/looking_for_an_intellectual/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"Hi all. I don't really believe in any one religion, I'm not patriotic, and I tend to think that subscribing to a belief system closes you off to other possibilities. I love philosophy, and lately I've gotten into some pretty deep topics with my partner. It's really hard right now and I am really feeling the pressure from family members. I don't watch the news because to me personally, it does more damage than good. Recently I stayed with my parents for a week, with the news on practically all day everyday. 
First off,
I love my family, I love my friends, and I am grateful for my existence. 
My stance on what is going on however, is hard for some, and even for me to swallow. We as a human species have a savior mentality. We have a hard time letting go. I recently had a very scary ""death"" experience and it didn't take me long to come to terms with letting go. I know that I am just living in the moment and I need to be okay with going at anytime. I would never impose this on anyone else or force other people to be okay with it. 
Yet, the idea that to ""save"" other humans and be a ""decent"" human being and just take a vaccine...it doesn't sit well with me. Not that I would intentionally cough on anyone...or intentionally spread disease. But inherently we are always causing others pain and death. The badge of honor and feeling of self-importance that comes with taking the vaccine is short-sighted at best...as is the choice to not take the vaccine. I see a lot of people clutching to what they think is true and factual. But the vaccine, nor the disease are the enemy. It has been us all along. We are the true enemy. 
So, my personal choice thus far has been to disengage and unsubscribe. I have no opinion to defend, so therefore I have nothing to be upset about. This is a dumpster-fire that I will not fuel. 
So, some may call me arrogant, idiotic, or selfish. But nothing about trying to escape or curb the death toll sounds natural to me. To be fair, vaccines have ""saved"" a lot of people from pain and suffering. But in this act, have we not also caused pain and suffering? There are more people on this planet than you can even fathom. Now that we can cure just about anything, there are more people than there naturally would be. By trying to save humanity, are we also bringing it's demise? 
Here's an example of this theory: Wildfires used to come and go as they pleased, without human intervention. Now, we curb the spread, and put them out as soon as possible. Not long ago, the large swath of land that we have been trying to defend has been building up fuel by sitting untouched. Now, it is one of the largest of wildfires yet. 
So, I would suppose that nature knew what it was doing by periodically burning land. (Aka periodically releasing new virus variants) But with silly humans stepping in, thinking we know best, we have caused one of the largest wildfires yet. And yet we still forget, that we are the enemy. Not the savior. Even though we dress up in our doctor, police officer, firefighting, judicial, lawmaking outfits.... We are still doing more damage than good. So if you can understand the point I am making, and see that I am not here for debate... But instead to help myself and hopefully others to see that their beliefs of what is right and wrong...may have only been to protect our own egos all along. We are all here in the same place, and we are all going to the same place. Would you rather be going out fighting, or in peace? Love and gratitude, thanks for reading...",2021-08-16,17,POST

I also know that every person is different and how their bodies react to them are different as well. But for me, I got the Pfizer one, and for the first 24 hours after the shot I was just tired, which I anticipated, so I slept it off, within 72 hours I would say I had a burst of energy, I didn't struggle to get up in the morning, which is rare. You see, I have major depression so sometimes just getting out of bed can be taxing. But, it was like I was having an emotional high and I was happy and just bursting with energy and stamina. This feeling lasted for almost two and a half weeks or so.
And my question is, was would that be considered a side effect or could that just be psycho schematic? Has this happened to anyone else?",2021-08-13,2,POST

We were originally going to wait for the vaccine to have full FDA approval out of caution, since we had COVID early on and knew that would grant us some level of immunity. Now, with the delta variant getting bad and her being a nurse and seeing firsthand how much more dangerous this variant can be than the alpha strain, we decided to go ahead and vax up. Now, to the meat of the question: Do I tell my parents, who are STAUNCHLY against the COVID vaccines, that I got vaccinated? The reasons they are against the vaccine are not just due to what they believe is a lack of effectiveness. For the record, they are not anti-Vaxxers in generalóonly with the COVID vax. They believe every conspiracy they see online and believe that the government is using it to control us. They arenít sure COVID is real, they theorize itís just the flu and the numbers have been faked. They think the vaccine is the mark of the beast and that weíre in the end times. They believe that the vaccine makes you infertile and could be a form of population control. They also believe the vaccine is designed to weaken people so we will be easier to control and that the reason the unvaccinated are being segregated is so they donít come together and ìfight back.î There is honestly so much theyíve said, I cannot list it all here.

121,os17hi,Vaccine hesitant? So was I!,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/os17hi/vaccine_hesitant_so_was_i/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"Remember that the most important thing is for you to come to your own conclusions. I was vaccine hesitant and I 100% get it. So maybe I can help make you come closer to a decision.
First off, I think it's important to throw down political affiliation. I'm breaking #4 but I won't bring it up again! I lean center-left and all of my friends are pretty left. So donít think of it as a left v. right deal like the media is portraying it to be.
And we were all vaccine hesitant. This was Fall of 2020.
The science was sound but we were all skeptical about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Keep in mind that it's always the case where you say something is supposed to work one way, and then it could end up doing something totally different.
An undeniable truth is that stage 3 usually lasts at a *minimum* of 1 year. We took into consideration also that the vaccine was approved under EUA. And the media was drumming cases of people dying from the vaccine, and the horrible experiences people were getting from it.
So trust me. *I get it*.
I work in a field where I was able to get the vaccine offered to me when it was in scarce supply in February. A few of my friends already had it due to their occupation- they were Phase 1, I was Phase 2.
I thought of two things: screw the media and thought that it would be selfish to turn it down when  offered the vaccine so early and when it was in scarce supply.
So I got it. And I did not die.
The closest thing I can relate to, is that the first day it felt like I was coming down with a cold. The second day I felt like I had a cold. With nausea. I felt pretty bad the next day of getting my 2nd shot that I was going to take the day off, but came back after a half day.
And the thing is, I pretty much was worse off than everyone at my workplace. A lot of them weren't affected. The only person who felt really ill already fought off COVID.
I believe that we should all do what's best for us and in public interest. There have been so many heartbreaking examples of people wishing they had gotten the vaccine as they were on their deathbed or when they were hospitalized.
Now we have the benefit of time- knowing what the vaccine does. There are still some unknowns but a lot of the gap I think has been filled.
If you have a medical condition or what a professional medical opinion, talk to your doctor about it.
I care for you and hope that you can come to the conclusion that the vaccine is in your best interest.

I want to get it to protect myself and others, and if there's a possibility of not being able to go abroad without one then I would like to have it. But my biggest concern is that they don't know the long term effects of the vaccine, and that it could cause issues with fertility. 
The issue with thalidomide is on my mind a lot, and I know time and technology has advanced since then but surely there's a reason why vaccines take years to develop? 
I think I would like the pfizer vaccine as I have a blood condition and that one is the most effective, so it puts my mind at rest, but the mRNA concept scares me slightly.
The main thing I'm concerned about is it causing issues with fertility in the future. I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to my baby. However, apparently the vaccine has been approved for pregnant women so surely it should be okay?
Does anyone know any information that could help me make my decision? Any help is appreciated!",2021-06-15,15,POST

I got my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, May 26th. I was expecting to have all the issues everyone talks about and actually didn't have any reaction to it. I think my reaction to the 1st dose was more severe (just pain in the arm).
It is now a week later and I woke up yesterday with a sore/red/slightly irritated uvula. Only other thing was coughing up some yellow phlegm once. Today I woke up and it's slightly worse, and I do feel like something is coming on. I am achey in my shoulders and neck.

It gave a brief history of when mRNA science was discovered, what it has potential for, but the main focus was on explaining how the mRNA Covid vaccines work.

Heeeey! A [link for the VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html)! Okay, I'm now going to explain the process of accessing the reports.
[Link of how to access](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html) VAERS Data. Mentioning having to download something.
Immediately the language is offputting to anyone who has never heard of a CSV file, or know what it means. This page is very text heavy with a massive disclaimer. Including ""VAERS cannot be used alone to determine if a vaccine contributed to adverse events or illness."" "" The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. ""
Who can submit to the VAERS?: Everyone. But especially healthcare professionals are, I think, required to do so.
What the hell is it?: "" VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also known as ìsafety signals.î  ""
2 boxes clicked of agreeing to terms and conditions aaaaand it is bringing me to [download datasets](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html?) based on a chart of hyperlinks of zip files of up to 46MB each. Each year has a zip file of 3 files. That year's VAERS Data (?? vague), the VAERS Symptoms (? also vague), and VAERS Vaccine CSV files. Okay I think its... okay they're basically columns for the... same file? I hate excel. 
So, I know there's a web access somewhere. I just have to find it.
Okay 7 minutes later I think I figured it out. You need to go to those 2 boxes of agreeing to the VAERS usage terms and conditions. Under the first box, there [is a link to access online.](https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html)
Immediately, research professionals everywhere sigh. If you're trying to beebop your way through just getting as much information as easily as possible, this is probably the place where you're bound to find one hell of a hiccup. Links to datasets and other types of datasets, a box of a link to a video to guide you through using the system, 4 links to different sections of the video.
Under Search VAERS data? Unclickable data search buttons. Scroll down.... accept the disclaimer.
Now you can do the data search. But there's an easier way to get specific well filtered information to get to the meat of the search. You're gonna wanna click on [""Request Form""](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=9C9E7978B708B8709B0D93CE9E13). And then futz around with the settings. If you are too vague, even if you narrow the side effect reactions to one single vaccine, you're going to have too many results for the system to handle and it'll shoot you back to searching. We need to be specific. In the drop downs i'm going to choose Vaccine Manufacturer, Age, Event Category, Symptoms, Project Number. With optional measures resulting in description, current illness, prior adverse events, and history/allergies.
Scrolling past 2 to section 3, i'm going to choose the COVID19 Vaccine. And then sort further by one specific manufacturer. I'll choose JANSSEN. Why not.
Scroll past to section 5 to further sort and filter event characteristics. I'm going to HOLD CTRL and choose Emergency Room, Perm Disability, Life Threatening, Death, Hospitalized, Birth Defect. All events.
Okay I need to select an ID in Group Results by list when requesting optional measures. Aaaaaa. Okay so in section 1 you have to choose one of your groups as the literal option ""VAERS ID"". Choose that one instead of project ID.
""Please simplify this request. 47,938 rows of cases of adverse reactions in permanent disability or worse. Uhhh shit that's not a good look. I guess i'll **only look in my age range.** Choosing 18-29 years in age. Okay.
Here we go. Raw friggin' information about all adverse reactions to the single dose JANNSEN vaccine for individuals in my age group.
And the first symptoms is... Autopsy! Enlightening!
[Here is a link of my search results.](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=9C9E7978B708B8709B0D93CE9E13) No idea if you're able to see them or not.

I can tell people are judging me for not being vaccinatedóas if it's my moral duty to do so. Plus I want to get back to life! I miss my friends.
My problem is that my spouse is vehemently antivax. Not all vaccines, just this one. He spends his days watching videos and reading articles on the supposed dangers of vaccination and he believes all the things, including that you shed spike proteins when you get vaccinated and that spike proteins can cause prion disease. He believes he sees the truth and everyone else is hoodwinked. He also needs to win every argument every time, so there is no reasoning with him. He's a hermit and doesn't give a damn about being around other people.
Personally I don't want to be part of the mRNA experiment but I'd be willing to get the J&J vaccine. Plus one and done will be much easier for me. There is no way I can get it and not tell him because it seems likely I will feel sick for a few days. If I get vaccinated it's going to cause me endless grief at home.

I   am not a ""medical"" person but I do like to read.  After studying the   science on how the 3 vaccines in the US were developed and generate   protection for recipients, I am at a loss to see how they really promote   ""herd immunity.""
In almost all  of  the studies and recommendations I have read such as this from Harvard ([https://www.health.harvard.edu/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines](https://www.health.harvard.edu/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines)) there is first the   admonition that current covid vaccines are critical to opening again and   reaching herd immunity.  Then somewhere just below that is the   discussion regarding the way that these vaccines work in the body and   that the vaccines don't prevent the virus from entering the body but   prevents "" moderate to severe symptoms"".  If the vaccines only reduce   the severity, how do they create immunity?",2021-05-13,10,POST

I have a complex medical history. In my late twenties with lupus with kidney involvement. It took a while to get diagnosed with lupus but knew for a while beforehand my immune system was out of wack. I had to have my tonsils removed because my they were enlarged, thyroid stopped working, kidney function declined, and my immune system was starting to attack my inner ear. 
Iím now on immunosuppressants post a transplant and everything has been going well. No new issues. I asked my endocrinologist, my nephrologist, and my rheumatologist about the vaccine and all are in agreement itís better for me to get it than not get it - but one mentioned there hasnít been much testing on patients taking immunosuppressants so Iím a little nervous - but my rheumatologist is saying that he believes the worst that would happen from that is I might not get the antibodies from the vaccine as if I didnít get it. He suggested coming up with a plan to pause the medication around the time of the vaccine. This seems very dangerous to me given that my immune system attacked my kidneys and ear.

We have had many discussion both calmly and in arguments. He works in tech and is quite happy working from home and only leaving our place except to go to the grocery store and the occasional meal outdoors making him less at risk and less likely to spread it. I don't agree with him, but I support him. He isn't an extremist, educated in science, and has done his research. The problem is I don't know how to approach his vaccine hesitancy with my/our friends. Ethically, we feel that he should disclose his unvaccinated status if someone comes over or if/when we start to meet friends indoors as well as other circumstances. Pretty much everyone else that I know has been vaccinated or is actively seeking vaccination. Some are very outspoken about why people should be vaccinated with a number of them being judgmental and not willing to take a moment to hear another point of few.

I would love to hear anyone elseís vaccine story to compare our experiences. I keep wondering why my side effects were so bad, why they lasted so long, and why were they so different from the 1st and 2nd.
First Shot:
I got really sick after my first shot. Running a high fever, extreme hot/cold chills (I would have to change my clothes at least 2-3x a day because they were soaked with sweat), extreme fatigue (felt so weak it was a struggle just to get up the stairs in our house), and horrible body aches. I really didnít sleep for almost 3 days because the body aches and sweating...I just couldnít get comfortable I was in a lot of pain. I did have some vomiting about 36 hours after the shot (when my fever was the highest) but that only lasted about 6 hours. I had no appetite at all and really had to force myself just to drink fluids. I was miserable for those 4 days...All this took me by surprise because from what I had heard most people donít get sick after the 1st shot it was mainly the 2nd one that gave them side effects. I didnít have hardly any arm pain from the injection though.
Second Shot:
I just had my 2nd shot a little over a week ago. This time I did get sick but it wasnít nearly as bad as the 1st time. I did run a fever but it was low and I didnít have very many chills or hot flashes this time. The mild aches and extreme fatigue/tiredness lasted around 7 days. My arm was very sore for 3 days after this shot and I had a large red area around the injection site. With the 1st shot I couldnít sleep I was so miserable then on the 2nd shot I couldnít get enough sleep. I was so tired it felt like I had been drugged. For the most part I slept for 5 days straight. I was starting to get concerned at this point since my symptoms didnít seem to be going away.... so I went to the doctors. He told me that everyone is different and that he had seen some people get sick for 2 weeks from the vaccine.  He encouraged me to force myself to do something small every day to push my body into being more active. So I pushed myself each day to get up and at least do some light cleaning around the house (wash dishes, sweep, etc...). Just doing some simple chores would wipe me out and I would have to take a few hour nap afterwards. I think pushing myself to do this helped though...the extreme tiredness did subside after the 7th day. 
So all in all the 2nd shot wasnít as bad even though the side effects lasted longer. I would rather sleep for days than be so miserable you canít sleep.",2021-05-02,6,POST

Does it mean..
A.  I am in one of two groups.  Either I am in the 95% which means I can NEVER get Covid, or I am in the 5% which means I can and will get it if exposed enough.
B. If continually exposed to Covid it will take me 95% longer to acquire it compared to an un-vaccinated person, but eventually I WILL get covid.  That is, every exposure I am 95% likely not to get Covid, but sooner or later I will.

Iím in an odd situation here. Someone close to me has informed me that they participated in a Covid vaccine trial last Summer. Theyíve been light on details, but did tell me they were sworn to secrecy upon agreeing to participate in the trials (and offered that as an explanation as to why they didnít tell me before this week).
Now everything Iíve read about the trials so far has indicated that there is absolutely no such secrecy requirement involved in vaccine trial participation. Can anyone in the know confirm or deny this? 
He also said that he was either given Pfizer, Moderna or a placebo on this trial. Again, as I understand it, any trial would be for only one specific vaccine, not two. Can anyone prove or disprove that?
Bonus points if you know about Pfizer/Moderna trials in the Detroit area taking place last Summer. 
Whatís at stake here: based on other, prior interactions with this person, Iím afraid he may be experiencing some sort of mental decline or early signs of dementia (unrelated to Covid) and has left me wondering if this story heís told me is truthful, a lie, a delusion or some mix. 
Any first-have insight you might have on these processes would be tremendously helpful and would offer some serious peace-of-mind to me and my family.

She was unmasked while talking with another unmasked person today for around one minute. I think it is unlikely that she would have gotten COVID from that person but Iím not sure. Should she get the COVID vaccine this Saturday or should she cancel the appointment? I heard that it could be dangerous if someone gets the COVID vaccine while theyíre infected with COVID but Iím not sure if this is true. I donít know if Iím overreacting or if this is reason enough to cancel the appointment. Any thoughts and advice appreciated.
CONTEXT: My mom has her Moderna COVID vaccine appointment this Saturday (so in two days). I told her to NOT put herself in any situation in which she could potentially get COVID before her vaccine appointment. I had told her that if anyone came to her house, she had to remember to wear her mask before opening the door. Today the gardener came to her house and knocked on her door to give her the bill. She opened the door without her mask on (she forgot) and had a brief one minute conversation with the gardener (he was not wearing a mask either) and then he left. Should I be concerned about this? I donít know if Iím overreacting and I wanted to ask you all about it. I think the chances of her getting COVID from that interaction is very very low but Iím not sure how to feel about it. The gardener did say that he got his J&J COVID vaccine yesterday, but he wasnít wearing a mask. They faced each other but were about 5-6 feet apart I think.
**The main reason why Iím concerned is because I heard that itís not ideal for someone who unknowingly has COVID (asymptomatic case) to get the COVID vaccine while theyíre infected.** I really hope she didnít get COVID from the gardener, but in the very small chance that she did, would it be really dangerous for her to get the COVID vaccine this Saturday? Should she just go through with her vaccine appointment this Saturday? Or should she cancel her appointment? (Sheís 75 and has stage IV lung cancer NSCLC btw)

I have not seen any other person in the last year. Its a very lonely and depressing time for me.

But the fatigue even though it got better on the 4th day, my energy levels arent back to normal..I cant walk without feeling dizzy. A couple of days ago, I started having some effort with breathing as well. I have been monitoring my oxygen levels (98-99%) and heart rate. I went to the urgent care where the rapid covid test was negative and PCR test results are awaited. They asked me to rest and checked my breathing which seemed okay to them..they said they have nothing so work with as vitals are okay. I

The reason why I said we're human Guinea pigs is they're giving just about every tier a different shot to see how we react to all 3 of the vaccine.

Full disclosure, I believe in vaccines, because I prefer data received from scientists, over some dumbass reading a FB post while sitting on a toilet. That being said, Health Canada can just stuff their AstroZeneca budget quality vaccine for people over 65.  AstraZeneca is only 70% effective on younger, healthy people, while both Pfizer and Moderna are 94% effective. As an over 65 Diabetic with high blood pressure,  circulatory problems, and Asthma, I want the best protection possible. When I was 64 and 11 months old, I could not get the over 65 flu vaccine (that had one extra strain included) because I was not 65. Guess which strain I got that year. I ended up with 3 ER visits, missed 3 full weeks of work, developed neuropathies, and didn't fully recover for several months. I say NO to AstraZeneca.

[Click here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/m1bzri/jj_shot_side_effects/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
Here's another great, detailed [Pfizer side effect log](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/mh7eoh/1st_2nd_dose_pfizer_vaccine_log_age_34_good/).
I thought I'd make a post about my 2nd vaccine experience and go into great detail on side effects. Hopefully it doesn't trigger an anxiety attack for you guys who are worried about it...
The first vaccine I got, the only side effect I had was extreme fatigue.
Overall it is not as bad as they say. To me it made me paranoid to hear of it knocking people out and how horrible it was. It was not like that at all.
The first one felt like I was coming down with a cold without the respiratory crud.
The second one felt like I had a cold without the respiratory crud.
The headaches weren't bad and I didn't need to take pain relievers. They were light headaches and dull. It was annoying enough for me to take a half day off work on Tuesday but I was able to go in the latter half of the day.
Yes there was arm pain, but that's normal for a vaccine.
Here's the log:
**3/1**
Vaccine administered - 8AM
Light headache - 9:30AM
Fatigue, no more headache - 11:00 AM to 4PM  (the ""I slept 4 hours"" kind)
Nausea & Fatigue - 4:15 PM
Fatigue, no more nausea - 7:00 PM
Fatigue, Headache, slight chills - 11:00 PM
**3/2**
Fatigue, headache, chills - 6:30 AM
(took off work sick)
Slight fatigue - 10:30 AM
(back to work)
Fatigue, chills, slight headache - 12PM to Sleep
**3/3**
Almost to normal - 5 AM

However, I can tell you that the spikes we are seeing in our region (N. Florida) are not all the flu. My fiancÈe is a med/surg nurse and there are people in their 20s and 30s being hooked up to vents and respirators because they canít breathe on their own. Their hospital right now is filled with COVID patients that are in very critical condition. ICU and PCU units are filled. As a med surg nurse, there are levels of care she isnít trained for and right now, even med surg nurses are having to learn as they go to administer a higher level of care because they donít have room for all these patients in the ICU and PCU. Now, I donít know about you, but I donít know the flu to cause THAT MANY people to be in critical condition in a matter of only two weeks. Two weeks ago, they have 0 COVID patients. After their first case of the Delta variant, it was like a dam had broken. These patients she is watching die are not being faked. Sheís witnessing it. That is why we chose to get the vaccine. Because a large majority of hospitalized patients are un-vaxxed. Because the vaccines are 80-85% effective against contracting the Delta variant and even if you do contract it, if youíre vaxxed, you are much less likely to have serious symptoms and be hospitalized.
Now, all this being said, I did not post this to have someone tell me my decision was wrong and to try to convince me to agree with my parents, who seem to the think the CDC, WHO, Harvard medical research, Yale medical research and more are untrustworthy and instead watch videos that get posted from some random Joe Blows on YouTube. If youíd like to be helpful, please do, but your response was clearly not what I was asking for. 
Side note: Florida yesterday (49% vaccinated) had 22,783 new cases. 199 people died from COVID. Israel, a fully vaccinated country, had 2,904 new cases and only 7 people died in the ENTIRE COUNTRY. The vaccines may not be 100% effective, but they are our best chance. And they are not dangerous. The RARE side effects are all much more treatable than they would be if you contracted the same side effects from the virus.
Edited to add:
Upon some research, the temporary EUA for the PCR test will be withdrawn to make way for new testing than can test and differentiate between influenza and COVID. Because the current test can only detect COVID, it would save time and money to be able to do a multifaceted panel-style test method.

Furthermore, the FDA did do a recall on the test administered by Innova Medical Group (and only by this company) because it had a risk of producing false negatives. Meaning, it did not test POSITIVE when it should. This was not every test. This was a localized number of tests produced only by Innova Medical Group. And, that just means there should have been more positive cases than there actually were.

The vaccine works very similar to a virus in terms of how it is made inside of cells. For example, with the Salk Polio vaccine (which was tested in just a year, this does not include development time which took much longer) we had no idea if suddenly 30 years later everyone would drop dead because of it, but we did it anyways and now polio is eradicated in the US. I would even argue that itís more dangerous to take the MMR vaccine than the COVID vaccine, because the viruses we use in MMR are capable of causing encephalitis (1 in every million kids). Yet we still give MMR to a vast majority of kids and itís saved a lot of lives.

COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus. We have plenty of coronaviruses floating about, and they have been doing so for as long as anyone knows, so yes, scientists have been studying coronaviruses for a very very long time. Before COVID-19, research peaked during the SARS and MERS outbreaks (both coronaviruses). COVID-19 is particularly dangerous because of its transmissivity and mortality rate, which are both higher than the flu. There are other viruses that are more transmissive and/or more fatal.
The mRNA vaccine is a new deployment. Research on mRNA has been going on for quite some time. I believe it started to show real promise (on the research side) around the time of the MERS outbreak, but they've been chugging along on it since. Most of our vaccine research is actually a continuation of the SARS and MERS coronavirus research. We were VERY lucky that COVID is a similar coronavirus, such that much of the research is applicable.

To answers your other question, the vaccine has been studied and has been in the works since January of 2020. Clinical trials began in the Summer of 2020. The FDA would never let an untested drug (especially a vaccine) go to market. Scientists have been studying corona viruses for a while now, theyíre nothing new. SARS, MERS, and some cases of the common cold are caused by them. Scientists have been testing mRNA for decades, it even exists naturally inside your cells. Personally, I had a friend who got myocarditis 2 days after he was vaccinated. He made a full recovery and only needed minor treatment and monitoring. Myocarditis is both rare and mild, many people donít realize they have it. Many viruses (including covid) can cause myocarditis, and other vaccines have been known to cause it. Youíre young, you will certainly not get a heart attack, stroke, paralysis, or blood clots from the vaccine. If you have asthma (I do too), itís even more important that you get vaccinated.

The vaccine is 9 months old
Sure I can create a new type of cake and I can bake it like any other cake, but saying decades of research is misleading if I use ingredients that have unknown consequences.
I had COVID, sure itís bad, but at least we have more data on the virus than the vaccine. We know what happens when you get Covid.
The way the body reacts to S-Proteins to create the antibodies and build immunity is definitely similar but the argument is way too simplified. There are permanent side effects that the vaccine causes that wasnít so abundant in the infection, infertility is one of them. Another is hypercardia, which was a major issue with Covid, but the vaccine commonly causes hypertension, related but different and debatably worse.
What happens when a year from now we discover that Spike Proteins from the vaccine have buildup in the BBB, or causes deformation in infants?
I understand wanting to make society safe again, but the vaccine canít be considered safe, yet. Itíll take more time.
In response to incoming ìackshuallyî, you canít say Iím wrong yet because we donít have the full research and time yet. You canít cheat 2-5 years of time.

I kept thinking that almost my whole town had the vaccine and nothing happened to them so I'll probably be good. I had the shot and stayed in the hospital for 30 minutes. If you're allergic that time is enough for symptoms to show up. The doctors were great and constantly checking up on me so i felt safe. Ask them any questions it's their job to answer. Then i spent the whole day doing things with friends and family so my mind was occupied. And when the symptoms hit i was like ""i felt this pressure on my chest before like 1000 times"". Try to recognise those symptoms! take some deep breaths and it will probably get better. If it doesn't you can always go to the hospital and explain your symptoms. A quick exam and they'll know its just your anxiety. I hope you live in a place where people are not getting the vaccine in their car or something...Everything will be good!

Something is really bothering me. So they came out with VAERS to 'appease' the vaccine scared population, who now I see is really just people wanting to hold others accountable, into silence by handing over some form of transparency. 
But... the way they created the VAERS is actually extremely troubling because listen to this...
They were told to make reports public on adverse reactions after vaccines in some way. They decided hey, why not let everyone be able to share their experiences with adverse reactions? Maybe that was a good intention for more data, but... maybe they were just designing the system to be intentionally useless
intentionally useless by creating the only vaccine reaction database that cannot be used for its purpose at ALL because of its open source feature. 
When they gather mass information in other sectors like Stats dept. and Census, they hire some of the most trained and qulified statisticians and workforce to ensure validity of every single bit of data that is made public.
But the only checks & balances system that is designed to catch real world, actual issues with a medication is fucking useless.

164,nekxni,Does the covid vaccine hurt?,https://www.reddit.com//r/COVIDVaccineTalk/comments/nekxni/does_the_covid_vaccine_hurt/gz0voz3/,COVIDVaccineTalk,"Advice if you're scared of needle sensation/injection pain:
I'm literally terrified of needles. Not the pain, but the sensation of the needle in my arm. 
Like, I had a full phobia that gave me panic attacks where I would cry like a five year old kind of fear. (CBT and anxiety treatment helped me lower it, but it was still a very debilitating fear in my life.)
Despite this, I convinced myself to get vaccinated for the sake of myself and others. It turned out to be way less scary than I thought. 
Tips that helped me:
My doctor suggested that I buy some over the counter roll-on lidocaine gel and apply it to my entire upper arm 40-60 minutes before my appointment. This numbs the surface of your skin, lessening the sensation of the needle (Also helps with the arm soreness afterwards).
Ingested painkillers are not recommended before the injection, so this is a great alternative if you're scared of pain/the needle sensation.
I found that helped me with feeling the sensation of the needle significantly less. It's a very small needle in comparison to other types of shots, and I barely felt anything. My pet scratching me during nail trims hurt more than the injection itself. The whole injection process took about twenty seconds.  
Then, I sat in a chair for 15 minutes to make sure there were no complications, and went on with my day. (Took a big nap after because I was sleepy).
If I can do it, you can too! 
Other assorted advice:
-if you're afraid of hospitals, schedule it at a pharmacy/ non-hospital vaccination center
-avoid caffeine before the appointment (helps you avoid getting jittery/dehydrated)
-bring a phone and headphones to listen to a podcast/videos, or play a game on your phone while you wait 
-being a friend or family member for emotional support if you're able to! (My sibling came with me and sat in the waiting room with me before the appointment, which helped)
Best of luck, you got this.",2021-12-21,1,COMMENT

The process itself felt closer to discomfort than pain. There was no sharp pain for me, my friends,or my siblings. (Everyone I spoke to relieved Pfizer/Moderna)
It was like a slight pinch, followed by a couple seconds of pressure, and it was over. (Like pinching your skin with your nails, holding for a couple seconds, and releasing). I was doubtful when other people said something similar, but it was not bad at all.  
If I were to compare it to other uncomfortable scenarios, it was:
Significantly less discomfort/pain than an (unintentional) cat claw scratch recieved during play, a bee sting, stepping on a Lego, an ant bite, sunburn pain, scratches from a rose bush, or a big papercut.",2021-12-21,1,COMMENT

Seriously. Why would people even think that this is a reasonable question to ask?People shouldn't feel pressured to share their vaccination status, or STI status, or anything else that is sensitive. Not with their friends, not with their families and certainly not for reasons of ""hanging out"". If someone feels that they absolutely need to know my health info before they hang out with me, maybe they're not worth hanging out with in the first place.
EDITS POST COMMENTS: I can no longer comment on this post so I cannot reply directly.  So My response to you Director\_Quirky: Vaccine ""passports"" as part of personal medical record and a way of keeping track of your information for yourself are harmless. But vaccine passports as a means of controlling who gets to get on a flight or go to a grocery store are a terrible idea and they infringe on personal rights. At any case, in the past proof of vaccination was required in very limited cases, certainly no one asked you if you got a flu shot before hanging out with you. This now is ridiculous. In some countries they are asking for these passports to attend gyms or shows. Does that mean that we should enhance this behavior further? By no means. We should fight it. And the first step would be to not behave as assholes ourselves and not to discriminate personally.

They said that if I'm vaccinated, then I'm fully protected, so I'm being inappropriate. It's taken me a couple of days to think out my response and in the meantime that poster has pulled the comment. But I still want to respond.
First, the vaccine is not 100% effective now, and new variants are developing to which it might be less effective. I'm more protected than I was before I was vaccinated, but I am not fully protected. If the other person has been vaccinated, our combined risk is very, very small, much smaller than the risk with someone whose vaccination status I don't know.
Second, I _am_ discriminating. Not all discrimination is immoral. I'm discriminating against people who are not behaving sensibly or responsibly during a pandemic, discrimination which is neither immoral nor unreasonable. Of course if someone has a medical reason they can't be vaccinated, I'll hang out with them - outside with masks on. But if they don't have a medical reason not to be vaccinated, and they're just choosing not to be vaccinated, then I can't trust that they're behaving safely in other aspects of their life with respect to the pandemic. I don't want to spend time with those people.
Finally, no one chose to get AIDS. To get AIDs, you have to exchange bodily fluids, which we knew quite early in that pandemic. It was easy to hangout with someone, share a meal, go on a bike ride, fall in love, while not exchanging bodily fluids with someone whose HIV status you didn't know. Covid is different. If you're hanging out with somebody, you're exchanging aerosols, sometimes even if you have a mask on.
So yes, with very few exceptions, I don't want to spend time with people who aren't fully vaccinated, and I will ask.",2021-12-21,0,COMMENT

>Anti-vaccinationism was relatively muted, however, when our modern era of vaccination got underway in the 1960s. In that decade, a series of new vaccinesóto prevent polio, measles, mumps, and rubellaówere developed in rapid succession. Just a few years before, the American public had greeted the first polio vaccine, released in 1954, with wild enthusiasm. Parents so dreaded polio that they were quick to seek the vaccine for their children, and coercive policies never became necessary. (3) A few voices spoke out against the vaccine, but they got little traction in a nation overwhelmingly desperate to prevent the disease.

I got the Astrazeneca vaccine and after the first dose I was so sick for over a week I couldn't even get out of bed, the symptoms after the second dose were milder but I still felt awful.
I got the Astrazeneca vaccine before all the reports came out about the risk of blood clots with it and I just have this strange fear of 'mixing' the Astrazeneca doses I had with a booster dose of Pfizer.
Logically I know theres more chances of me getting a blood clot from the likes of my contraceptive pill but I am honestly just afraid that the booster dose will harm me somehow.
Obviously I will get the booster as the idea of getting Covid terrifies me equally! 
Did anyone else feel nervous about getting the booster and what were your experiences after it?

I lost 100lbs in 2019. I took horrific care of my body back then, developed severe acid reflux, gallstones, and was terrified of blood clots and any other repercussions of the way I was treating myself.
I have since lost the weight, but the extreme fear has stuck with me. I was doing much better until COVID, after lots of therapy and taking much better care of myself. Before, I sometimes wouldn‚Äôt sleep because my anxiety convinces me my teeth are loose in my mouth, and that they will fall out in my sleep. I feared disease, and I also feared a lot of (not all of) modern medicine, in a lot of ways. Pain-killers, heavy medication, I always feared the effects that they have on the body. Now, since COVID, I have been a total mess.
I am the only person I know that is not vaccinated. My parents make me feel awful about it daily, my boyfriend whom I live with has made comments that make me fear he is going to leave me, and I can tell that he is frustrated. My best friend of over 15 years won‚Äôt speak to me. Every time I log onto social media I am being told I am a menace to society. I don‚Äôt leave my house - I work entirely from home and order all my groceries. I went from being a social person to a complete recluse, and my mental health is at an all time low. I am terrified of the vaccine and heart inflammation, side effects, etc. I don‚Äôt trust big pharma. I am terrified of COVID. I don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúrandom people spewing fear‚Äù. I genuinely feel crazy, alone, isolated, and absolutely terrified 24/7. 
I cannot tell if I am more afraid of Covid or the vaccine. I feel like regardless, i‚Äôll be shunned by society if I don‚Äôt get all of these shots but will be debilitatingly anxious if i do. I am in a lose-lose and I feel alone, knowing that my friends think i‚Äôm an ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù. I genuinely do not think I can take this anymore. I feel like this one decision determines how people will view me for the rest of my life. 
Should I just take it to make everyone happy and then admit myself somewhere? I don‚Äôt think I could handle the aftermath mentally.
TLDR: I am terrified. I don‚Äôt know what to do, and don‚Äôt know that I ever will. I‚Äôm losing everyone over this.

It happened 1 day after getting vaccinated for Japanese encephalitis, and I had to stay in hospital for 2 months wheelchaired.

I cannot make okay sign with my left hand.
 The cause was not clearly identified while neurologists at the time told me not to get vaccinated anymore.
 Several times I asked for doctor‚Äôs opinion at different places because I wanted to get vaccinated if possible (i still feel the same, especially for hpv). But they mostly advised me not to take the risk, saying the chance is statistically very low but it already happened once.
But now with the strict guidelines for covid vaccine, I‚Äôm banned from many places. If I go to the public health center I suppose they will stick to the guidelines and just give me the shot.

Was pretty much normal until the second dose.
hey guys, I just wanted to come on here to tell you my experience with the vaccine. It was in fact unpleasant, getting the shitty uncommon side affects that I have up until now. 
So all this happened after my 2nd jab (26th nov), the day I got the vaccine I was completely fine. I‚Äôll also mention that the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I got, I was fine just a had a sore arm, and I was expecting the same side affects with the second jab. Boyyyyy was I wrong. The day after i felt faint, had horrible brain fog everything felt like a dream. When night came, I noticed it was getting a lot harder to breathe, also getting heart palpitations, I couldn‚Äôt sleep on my side I had to sleep on my back which was still really uncomfortable. So I am still young (16f) so it kinda worried me, i asked dad to take me to ER.
Went to ER, got an ecg done, came out normal and was gonna get blood test done at the GP. So yeah basically felt like a waste of time to go to the ER. 
So its been like a week with those same side affects (heart palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, random increases of heart rate, brain fog) and then I notice it going away day by day until I felt slightly normal so I thought it was going away and so I didn‚Äôt end up going to the GP. 
Fast forward like a week, I start to feel that discomfort in my chest again but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable, so I kinda just ignored it, then over a span of a few days I think I just felt it getting more noticeable and worse. This time it feels like my lungs were so sore, breathing was getting more difficult, having a loss of appetite, throat was feeling a little tight and just had the constant need to clear it (like I had phlegm or something). Sleeping was the most difficult thing for me not being able to find a comfortable enough position to sleep in and the sore lungs and just having that constant presssure on my chest made it unbearable. That‚Äôs when I was like oh shit, here we go again and dad took me to ER cause at that point I was just stresssing about what could potentially be wrong with me.
So at the ER, I did get an ecg, blood test and x-ray done and all seemed to come out normal. They said that do have people who come into ER with reactions to the vaccine. They told me they ruled out any major issues (like pneumonia, any infections) so I was kinda relieved but yeah they said they don‚Äôt really know the reason why some people get reactions like this to the vaccine. They did give me this medicine to see if I had acid reflux but I didn‚Äôt have a reaction so that was ruled out too. I was checked up for the GP next year in jan and told me I should still see the GP just to run other tests and make sure. I was sent home, and told that I should take both Panadol and ibuprofen for pain everyday.
So basically that‚Äôs what happened, all happened in the span of a month and I‚Äôm literally writing this a couple hours after being in the ER, I find that reddit can kinda be reassuring and I just wanted to share my experience. I wanted to know if anyone else could relate to me in someway, as this has been such a scary and horrible time for me. I can also give updates as time goes by.

I got covid a few months back. Before this I found I was pregnant and almost immediately had the worst morning sickness so I wasn‚Äôt in the best place physically to get the vaccine. I had been doing research into it since it was approved by the FDA. If I were to get the vaccine I would be the only one out of my family and my in-laws to receive the vaccine. I live in a very anti vaccine environment and the only advice I get is to not get it. I know people who have lost loved ones to covid and I really want to be responsible for me and my future family. But I also know people who are suffering from side effects of the vaccine. I don‚Äôt really believe the vaccine will cause infertility. But I‚Äôm also seeing the news and that vaccinated individuals can still spread the virus. Now they‚Äôre saying to get boosters and to be honest I‚Äôm not really interested in getting shots every 9 months. I already had covid. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread. I‚Äôm not sure what the point is anymore. The only reasoning I can think of is pharmaceutical companies want their money. And I‚Äôm just a number. I feel stuck between two hard places. I really feel strongly about doing the right thing but I‚Äôm not sure what path that is. Any opinions or reliable sources to research are welcome. Thanks for reading.
Edit: Thank you all for your input and articles for me to read. I appreciate you taking the time to help me educate myself. I will read everything and talk to my obgyn at my next appointment. I don‚Äôt believe the vaccine will cause me a miscarriage. I‚Äôm apart of a lot of pregnancy groups and many women get it and have healthy babies. A lot of them do wait till the 2nd trimester as the 1st trimester is a really fragile time. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking into it now. Again thank you for your responses.",2021-12-19,3,POST

17,ripat5,"Got Moderna, wanted to talk side effects",https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/ripat5/got_moderna_wanted_to_talk_side_effects/,CovidVaccine,"Hi! I got my first shot of moderna Tuesday and just wanted to talk about things that I've noticed. For some context:
* I'm usually viscerally aware of changes in my body. I experience chronic pain and am usually acutely aware of new sensations, ""different"" types of pain, and so on. I'm no stranger to being bedridden.
* I use a wheelchair. Not super relevant, but. Ambulatory. So I can walk sometimes.
* I'm AFAB, and was menstruating. I am not a woman, I'm nonbinary (they/them). My periods are bad all-around.
* I experience migraines frequently. For anywhere between 6 hours and 4 days.
* I have severe asthma. Sometimes I cough. Sometimes I have tightness of chest.
* I have *not* had covid.
Some things that I noticed:
* I had no panic going in to getting the vaccine; within the first 40min of it, I experienced warmth and a bit of difficulty swallowing (but I could still swallow).
* Tuesday night, I started having fever and chills. This was about four hours after the vaccine.
* I didn't sleep well Tuesday night. I woke up every so often with a pressure-feeling headache clustered and throbbing on one side of my head.
* Wednesday, I developed a cough. I first started coughing every so often during the afternoon. Not frequent, just every so often. The headache was still going.
* My period just straight-up stopped. I bleed extremely heavily, and I bleed for anywhere between 5-7 days with pretty bad bodily pains, headaches, sometimes a fever accompanies it, severe cramps, etc. But all of it just... Stopped the night I got the vaccine. ~~I doubt it will but if it somehow fixes my miserable periods then heck yeah thank you moderna~~
* I experienced tightness of chest, and shortness of breath. This didn't feel relevant to my asthma.
* During the first few hours of the day, I was able to do light stuff without the headache being overwhelmingly uncomfortable.
* Around 5pm, it got to the point where I had to lay down and eventually nap--I was exhausted, the fever was a lot, the headache was miserable, I couldn't focus or think--I had brainfog.
* By 8pm, I was completely bedridden. My husband (who also had gotten the vaccine, had never had covid, and has had no side-effects minus sore arm/the fever on the first night) had to get me food/drinks.
* I didn't have much of an appetite, and quite frankly, the texture of food made me nauseous. I just wanted something cold and sweet to dull the weird taste in my mouth that always accompanies fevers, and to maybe take the fever down some, so I ate icecream.
* I couldn't sleep at all. I woke up every 30min to an hour, sometimes two hours.
* Thursday, I was bedridden. Just curled up. Miserable. We tried to watch some low-energy things. But I couldn't really focus. Light was too much, sound was too much. It was pretty painful.
* Today, Friday, I ended up curled up in bed until around 10am with a headache. A fever didn't pop up until around 2pm.
* The throbbing headache has not gone away. It's persisted.
* I can move around now. I can walk, but I have to get up and down very, very slowly, and I have to turn my head slowly. I can't bend down or lean over the edge of my wheelchair, if I do, the headache becomes unbearable to the point where I become nauseous, dizzy, and end up in tears.
That's about it with my experiences so far.",2021-12-18,4,POST

A few days after getting vaccinated I developed a sore throat but only on the right side of my throat, (mainly hurting when I swallowed) which is the same side I was vaccinated on. It was sore for a month before finally going away. Around the time it started to go away though I developed a weird head ache thing. It's like a stabbing pain in the back of my head behind my right ear. It kind of comes and goes..it was very noticeable and annoying but it's better now..it is still happening a little. The right side of my nose gets stopped up every time I lie down, this is still happening. I also have been having a lot more trouble getting full breaths, particularly when I try to yawn, I just can't alot of the time. Any thoughts or similar experiences? Thanks!",2021-12-15,5,POST

I‚Äôm 27m and never had any health issues. Always been fit and healthy exercising 5 times a week.
I wasn‚Äôt going to get the vaccine but ended up doing so after hearing about Covid passports in the news.
I was fine after my 1st dose of Pfizer.
I got the 2nd dose and 3 days later had palpitations during the half time period of a football match for around a minute then becoming faint. 
I have been in and out of hospital staying overnight in the cardiologist department.
I was released from hospital with an ECG device that was linked to an app on my phone, they gave me this as they weren‚Äôt sure what the cause was and wanted to capture it, I caught it multiple times to which they have advised the rhythms are normal and aren‚Äôt concerning even though the BPM are up at 120 every time.
It‚Äôs now 5 weeks since my 2nd dose, the heart palpitations have subsided from happening 1-2 days apart to around a week apart. 
Just before the heart palpitations I would have a really hot flush/flash come through my whole body, my heart would then begin to race and palpitate. I would then also get body shakes/tremors.
The palpitations do seem to be going away now but still having a few issues.
Is anyone else experiencing this ? 
As I‚Äôve always been healthy I‚Äôve never dealt with an issue with my health and I am trying to stay positive and strong but it‚Äôs getting harder and harder the longer it goes on and I just want it to pass. It‚Äôs also so worrying whilst it‚Äôs happening.
Would really appreciate to hear from someone who has experienced this over this period of time and it passed.
Fyi I have never suffered from panic attacks or anxiety so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that even though it did make me anxious to begin with.
Thanks :)",2021-12-14,12,POST

Hello there,
I got the Moderna booster (half dose) yesterday (1st and 2nd vaccination also Moderna). I'm a little surprised that I didn't really find anything on the internet about the antibodies, etc for homologous vaccinations with Moderna. Does anyone know more about this? For example, I found something that if you get Astrazeneca twice and then get boosted with Moderna, you get 32 times as many antibodies. Of course, you have to consider that you have less antibodies with 2 times Astrazeneca than with 2 times Moderna. So, theoretically, would my vaccine protection (3 times Moderna) still be higher than 2 times Astrazeneca then boosted with Moderna?
Thx!

Some of us just don't want it, sister is scared of it. My dad has had reactions to vaccines in the past. We have just booked to have our first dose but I'm not gonna lie, we still don't want it, it's more that we have the feeling we have to get it as more and more freedoms are being taken away from unvaccinated people. 
We're due to go to Paris in March, I have my honeymoon in June to las vegas and then my partner and I are going to Greece in September. We know that without vaccines we won't be able to go to any of these places. Because of this we have left it until the last week that we could have the first one to allow a 12 week gap between having the second one and leaving us 2.5 weeks before travelling to France (checked the government guidance and its 2 weeks after the 2nd dose you can travel). 
So they are booked in. But I'm concerned about it as I've been reading people's reactions to it and honestly I would be daft not to have concerns reading about heart palpitations. My mum is allergic to iodine and although I have researched it and it says there isn't any in them, it's still a concern. The doctor said that there will be a paramedic on stand by for if anything happens but honestly I don't find that comforting, if anything it worries me a lot more! 
Am I over reacting? I see people saying the reactions are very low cases, but I seem to see a hell of a lot of people saying things about reactions and it doesn't seem low to me?
Any advice or thoughts? I honestly don't see us being allowed uncontrolled lives soon without a vaccine and I think it's awful :(

43,r4rv48,Random Facts About the Covid (and other) Vaccines for the Skeptic; According to the CDC and FDA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/r4rv48/random_facts_about_the_covid_and_other_vaccines/,CovidVaccine,"Saw a bit of apprehension in the community regarding receiving the vaccine, here‚Äôs some information I have compiled that I hope will dispel any misinformation. 
‚Ä¢ Covid-19 has killed an estimated 773,812 people at the time of writing this.
- 405,175 (Over half of this total population) are 75 years of age or older; i.e. within the average age of death according to U.S. life expectancy. It may be fair to say that this population would be dying in equal numbers from other illnesses or natural causes. 
‚Ä¢ Covid-19 IS unarguably the largest threat to our global health. When compared to heart disease, that claims an average of 659,000 lives in the U.S. per year (a mere 1,318,000 estimated since the start of the pandemic) across a much wider age bracket, it is important to understand that making the choice to Vaccinate is our best line of defense against this Virus and it‚Äôs subsequent variants. 
‚Ä¢ Vaccines must undergo a multi-step process to ensure their efficacy, and most importantly, their safety.
-This process averages in the 10-15 year time frame, before the vaccine is released to the public. Control groups are utilized in order to compare the vaccinated to the unvaccinated. This ensures that their will be no long term side effects before release of product to the general population. If scientists where to release a new vaccine technology without following the above criteria, it would be IMPOSSIBLE (regardless of the amount of theoretical research previously conducted) to know if there where any unknown long term side effects according to the guidelines laid out by the FDA. (You may have to dig for this info, the FDA has removed time estimates on this process recently)
‚Ä¢Your employer has every legal right to demand you become vaccinated to continue your employment, however unlikely, if you do suffer an adverse even they are legally protected thus you can not sue them.
‚Ä¢You may not sue Vaccine manufacturers.
‚Ä¢You may not sue the government should Vaccine mandates take ahold.
‚Ä¢ Research into a Polio vaccine commenced around 1932, and the first licensed vaccine was released in the year 1955.
‚Ä¢When looking at reports of Death & Adverse Events with the use of Jansen, Moderna, and Pfizer COVID vaccines ( via VAERS), only 25,973 events are reported. -Note that although physicians DO utilize and trust VAERS, anybody can submit an event and thus VAERS could be considered speculative. Do your own reading, but keep in mind that some reporters may have a biased take.
‚Ä¢An argument attempting to discredit Dr. Fauci that anti-vaxxers tend to use: ‚ÄúThe National Institute of Health (NIH) funneled money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) via EcoHealth Alliance in order to research Gain of Function, where a strain of COVID with modified spike proteins, was introduced to a group of mice that became sicker than their control counterparts (those infected with the unmodified COVID virus)
-This claim is unsubstantiated. The NIH changed the definition of ‚ÄúGain of Function Research‚Äù the day after the above information was made public. They have, and continue to abide by these newly defined outlines.
‚Ä¢‚ÄùIn order to compare long term effects of the vaccine, as stated above, there needs to be an unvaccinated control group. This will challenge any ambiguity in regards to cause should we come to find that there are adverse effects.‚Äù
-Incorrect. Scientists have studied the theory of mRNA for decades and thus this FDA protocol does not apply.
‚Ä¢***Disclaimer***; While although the vaccine WILL protect you. After vaccination , you likely have the same potential to both transmit and receive the virus. In addition, the symptoms may be similar to those that are unvaccinated at the time of infection.
Anyways, hope this information clears up any doubt about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and the vital role they play in protecting all of us. The best way to combat misinformation is to speak out when we see it.",2021-11-29,4,POST

I  am currently in my 7th year working as a nurse and have taken care of   thousands of people within those years. I am hesitant of getting the  covid vaccine for several reasons and unfortunately will end up getting  it due to no other choice. I would like to discuss the pros and cons of  it to better help my decision of getting it. While I am not anti-vax, I  do have my concerns regarding the covid vaccine.
A  recent in vitro study came out and talked about how the covid spike  protein diminished the cells ability to proliferate and produce the  enzymes needed to repair the dna in the nucleus by inhibiting BRCA and  53BP1 in immune system cells, specifically B cells and T cells. If this  occurs it can ultimately lead to cancers and other abnormalities caused  by the cells inability to repair the dna.
Considering  the covid vaccine is the first vaccine that introduces mRNA into the  cell, I am extremely concerned about the long-term effects of this  vaccine. While I hope this is a new advancement with medicine, I feel it  needs to be studied and researched more.

52,qwnwhv,What should I do? Any vision is welcomed here!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/qwnwhv/what_should_i_do_any_vision_is_welcomed_here/,CovidVaccine,"&#x200B;
Hello redditors! Well, as always I'm still debating what on earth I'm going to do with the vaccine.
For the record, I am a 19 y/o girl (born in 2002) who is actually 17 years old (body-wise) due to having a slower maduration rate, so let's say everything eccept my mind/capability of understanding is 17 years old.
I am a healthy person that doesn't really expose herself a lot, I am just a uni student and the most ""extreme"" thing I do is taking the bus with a lot of vaccinated people.
In my country (Argentina) people absolutely trust the vaccine and not too many side effects are known, the worst I have heard of is tinnitus caused by the AstraZeneca one (my mum had that side effect for like 2 months but she states she feels just fine now). Everyone in my family got it, 2 of them the AstraZeneca and one of them the Sinopharm (which tends to be the one offered to younger pals, probably due to the fact that it's less strong: ""Researchers say this type of vaccine seems to be less potent because it triggers an immune response against many viral proteins. By contrast, mRNA and viral-vector vaccines target the response to the spike protein, which is what the virus uses to enter human cells."" (Source: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02796-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02796-w))
In my case, I'm exposed to social media way more than all my family members (no, we DO have internet, please don't picture Argentina to be an extremely poor country with people that only know how to dance and play football -yeah I have heard enough about those stereotypes if you'd like to check how our country is actually like you can do it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaDjNMF7hzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaDjNMF7hzo)). Anyways, as I'm more exposed to social media, also due to the fact that I was lucky enough to have been taught English since a very young age, I tend to read a lot about certain topics and the vaccine is one of them. If it hadn't been for the internet I would have probably gotten the vaccine without even thinking about it but right now I just can't do that.
I must say I am not an antivaxx but I am quite skeptical about the whole vaccination. I do not believe the virus is fake or some random bullshit that some random man or lady wrote on Facebook, I do take into account real experiences rather than ""conspiration thoughts"". 
What I believe is that some people are missing the main point: we are ALL in danger, regardless if you are vaccinated or not, why? well, it's simple. Life right now could be compared to a Russian Roulette: if you get covid you can suffer from long-run side effects, BUT THAT'S NOT FOR SURE, and if you get the vaccine you can ALSO suffer from long-run side effects, BUT THAT'S NOT FOR SURE EITHER. This has to do with every single one of us individually, with how our bodies are, how our DNA is... Therefore until we have come far enough to be to tell how compatible any single of us is with the vaccine (it would be amazing if scientists could develop some sort of ""compatibility test"" PRE-VACCINE, so anyone could see how our bodies would react to it. I am not a scientist, I study International Relations, but I am sure that could be developed if they at least tried. That way the whole Russian Roulette, at least the vaccine one could be solved).
Either way, the main point of this post is not me talking about some sort of utopia but me asking for ADVICE. Of course, I am not taking per granted strangers' opinions BUT hearing from real people rather than bots or people that only get their sources from TV might help.
Right now I am in a position where I change my mind every day, one day I want to get it and the other (like today) I don't. Right now I am thinking of waiting until 2023 but am I not sure -of course, this could happen only if the vaccines are not compulsory till then-, what I am sure of is that I want to live a healthy life rather than suffer all of it. I would honestly KMS instead of suffering. 
Thanks a lot for your advice!! 
PS: I shall add I always wear my mask so I never ""harm"" others.
Edit: I shall add seeing subs like r/HermanCainAward makes me feel like trash as an unvaccinated person. I just want to be safe but nowadays that‚Äôs hard to archive regardless of which path you end up taking.",2021-11-18,3,POST

56,qvhtqz,Tell me why I should get vaccinated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/qvhtqz/tell_me_why_i_should_get_vaccinated/,CovidVaccine,"Bio:
I‚Äôm 24, male, I work out every morning, I eat healthy every day, i don‚Äôt smoke, I focus on being the healthiest version of myself. I also am a social worker, i wear a mask at my workplace everyday to protect my clients and collegues and respect the distance I have to take with my collegues and clients. 
Why I didnt't take the vaccine (yet):
In the beginning of Covid, i didn't trust the vaccines. The process of the development of the vaccines went all too fast for me. I also know a lot of people (in my direct and indirect environment) that had side-effects after taking the vaccine. 
Another reason why I didn't take the vaccine, is that I (as non-vaccinated) can spread Covid as much as someone that is vaccinated. IF there would be a vaccine that would drastically lower the chance of spreading the virus, it would higher the chance of me taking a vaccine. 
At this moment, i don't believe in the strategy that the government is trying in my country. I live in Belgium and they're now starting to force people to take the vaccine (f.e health workers). I can't even find a reason why they're forcing health workers to take the vaccine, since a vaccinated person can spread Covid as much as someone that didn't take the vaccine. For me, the only reason to take the vaccine is for reducing the chance of getting the symptoms of Covid. Reducing the chance of spreading the virus is (as far as I know and as far i've done my own research) irrelevant to this. 
Since i'm trying to be as healthy as possible, I prefer to take the risk of getting sick of Covid over preventive taking the vaccine, which would just reduce the chance of getting sick for only a couple of months. 
Another example why I don't trust in the strategey of my government, is that my government doesn't want to allow non-vaccinated people to go out. So only people that got a vaccine are allowed to go out. In my opinion, they're just forcing non-vaccinated people to take the vaccine. I don't think this is fair since when I go out, I take a PCR-test and I'm sure that I don't have Covid. People that are vaccinated don't know that for sure.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not 'anti-vax'. I work with clients that have an unhealthy lifestyle (smoke a lot of cigarettes, eat unhealthy, don't have an active lifestyle,..). I tell them that it's better for them to take the vaccine since their risk of getting sick (or die) of Covid is much higher. I also see the benefits of older people getting the vaccine. I just don't feel like the government can force people to take a vaccine and reduce people's freedom. I think the discussion whether you should get the vaccine or not, should be led with your physician. 
My questions:
- After reading my opinion on vaccines, where am I wrong? If I'm wrong, i'd love some articles that prove me wrong (with a good source). 
- Why should I, as a healthy individual, take a vaccine? 
- Any other perspectives that you can give me?

I am by no means a perfect specimen but I workout 5x a week and play soccer twice a week. I have had COVID, while it wasn't much fun I have honestly had worse bouts of sickness. So far I have decided to not have the vaccine as I don't feel like I need it (every year I don't have the flu jab either) and I am concerned with the lack of long-term research. In normal circumstances I would not consider myself in anyway to be anti-vax.
To my knowledge there isn't any concrete evidence that proves the vaccine reduces the ability to transmit the virus and only seems effective (at least in the short-term) at reducing the effects of symptoms for the individual. I am supportive of other people choosing to be vaccinated for that reason including my own family, though I don't necessarily support having to have boosters indefinitely as a solution to the problem.
Honestly, a now major part of my hesitancy is viewing the treatment of those un-vaccinated. For example, the past 18 months we have held healthcare workers/ first responders on a pedestal and now they are being told No Jab - No Job. How can we all of a sudden turn our backs on the people who have been on the front line of this pandemic for making a decision on what to put in their body? Especially when they have got all the first hand stories to tell.
I have seen a lot of misinformation on both sides of the argument but can anyone point me to actual studies/ information that would convince me that us all being vaccinated would make any difference and be worth the risk? I'm going to need more than emotive language, it seems there is good number of people who are able to lash out at others without actually providing a solid argument.
Final Note: When I asked my own doctor what I should do he did recommend it however said he didn't think it was the difference between life and death for me.",2021-11-12,29,POST

As a disclaimer, I am not an antivaxer and actually consider the vaccine a miracle. I work in healthcare, so I got vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available back in February. Unfortunately, I just tested positive for Covid yesterday (again, not saying the vaccine didn't work; it's been much better than it could have been). I started feeling a little sore throat 4 days ago, but I thought it was just the weather. I go to a University where 80% of the student body and 90% of the faculty are vaccinated, and it's the only place I go besides my home. Because of this, I figured it to be very unlikely that I had Covid, and I went to school on Monday. But halfway through the day I could tell it was more than just the weather. So I stayed home from my last class and booked a Covid test appointment. When I got my test, I asked my doctor if I should go to class while I waited for my results. They asked if I had been vaccinated; I replied that I had, so they told me I should be fine to go to class as long as I wore a mask (a requirement at my university anyways). So I went to class that day, and later that night found out that I had Covid. 
So the potential downside I see is this: If people are vaccinated, would they be less likely to assume that what they have is Covid, and therefore not take the necessary precautions until it's too late and by that time have possibly infected someone else with an underlying comorbidity? It seemed that in my case both myself and my doctor seemed to make that assumption prematurely, and as a result I may have put someone else in danger. If I hadn't been vaccinated, I know I would have stayed home the minute I felt a sore throat because that's what I did all of last year.  Additionally, my wife is fully vaccinated and wasn't showing any symptoms, so she's been going to school everyday until I tested positive. Thoughts?",2021-10-14,9,POST

After all the fake or not news and articles I've read, containing national conspiracy and political stances, I'm really confused on whether or not Covid Vaccines are actually safe, as a lot of articles and videos show that it's harmful, also counter-arguments saying it's not. My parents are also worried and do not want me to take the vaccine, but I really want to continue my running start program. Can anyone give me some genuine facts and evidence on how the vaccine is safe to take?
Some articles or videos I've seen, for example, a new report that a kid died after taking the Covid vaccine shot, fertilization after a vaccine shot, heart diseases and etc. 
Questions coming from my family about: 
""Why do colleges and universities have students and faculty take mandatory vaccine shots? It kind of shows that the vaccine does not work when you have to be vaccinated to be next to after already vaccinated people.""
 ""The vaccine has come out for only a year or so, so no one is sure about the after-effects could be, or how long till the side effects will be activated. We might die like 10 years from now on because of this vaccine."" 
They don't want me to take it because no one knows the side effects and making sure our families are safe is their top priority, so I can't really say anything about that.
I tried to come up with some counter-arguments but didn't go very far, so can anyone help to explain the Covid vaccines more thoroughly? And how stable is the vaccine?",2021-09-28,12,POST

My relative was under the echmo machine for two days, showed signs of improvement, when they took off the echmo they wanted to do a tracheotomy,but they never did cause the first day after they were waiting for the documents, waited 3 more days, waited until his conditions worsened and the tracheotomy couldn't be done. I read that with tracheotomy there is a lower possibility to get a septic infection. Now they blame us cause he wasn't vaccinated,which causes us to be even more sad and heartbroken. Truth is, that he didn't get vaccinated due to a heart condition (arythmia and tachicardia, coronary problems) and varyces. There is a lot of false information about the vaccine. We are not no vax but we were unsure if the vaccine could cause a trombosis in a person who already has heart and circulatory conditions. Then why did they say he improved in 2 days, and then after a week, in the last 48 hours he worsened? They said they gave him too many antibiotics that worsened him and basically killed even the good bacterias,which cause the septis. I am just so mad and I want clarity. 
Did they wait too much? They said he improved so fast and took off the echmo and then waited to carry out the tracheotomy. 
Do you think it's negligence? They clearly told me that they waited and the antibiotics weren't the right ones. I just want to understand what happened. I cry every single day if he could have been saved. Because if a patient improves, and the ct shows improvement of the lungs and almost overcoming the covid infection,why should he get a septic infection in the reanimation?
I asked the doctors why,since intensive therapy should be steril and clean and he said 'it's not granted,it's not'.
I asked our GP and she said they are blaming us for the vaccine to cover a negligence. She also says that intensive therapy should be clean and that too many antibiotics can be worse than good. She said that they probably did some error and they don't want to say it and cover it under the covid issue. But he was actually healing from covid.

Some of my family members are anti-vaxxers. I didn't tell them I got the first dose until after I had already had it for a week. Immediately after I got it I started having really bad anxiety. Suddenly out of nowhere I started having panic attacks for the first time in years. 
I'm not sure what side effects I had to the first dose if any. All of the symptoms I had could have been from the vaccine or they could have been from anxiety. But I did end up in the ER because of a panic attacks that made my arm go numb and I thought I was having a heart attack. I'm scared to get the second dose because of the side effects they've been telling you about. Vaccine injuries, facial paralysis, heart problems, blood clots. I'm really scared of the side effects and I really don't want to end up back in the ER with a panic attack... 
I have my second appointment book but I'm not sure if I can pyche myself up enough to go. I know I should and logically I know that I'm probably not going to have any serious side effects. But I can't shake the anxiety... All of my friends have it and none of them had any issues.

My mother is a nurse. Her job sent out an email stating that mandatory vaccinations are now required to work, they gave all of the employees a deadline to do this. The deadline has expired and my mother has refused to take the vaccine her reason being she doesn't want to feel like it's forced. She officially lost that job and has now taken up a job in a different state... this is a contract term. 
I, my sister, and brother all live with her (we are all working adults). She's been going through financial hardships for a while now and this just added something new to her plate. She can barely pay the rent month to month at the current place we live in and now that she working in a completely different state she's also paying rent at the place she's living at there. 
I myself am vaccinated, and I understand the hesitation when it comes to taking the vaccination especially in the black community, I tried to explain to her that because she is a healthcare worker the vaccine is sooner or later going to become mandatory for this field but she doesn't want to feel like she's being forced to take it. While I understand personal choices, I think the choice she's making is causing our family more bad than good.
I've already made plans to move out soon and my other siblings also have financial responsibilities, she asked for my help financially because she's not certain of her finances at this point. I don't mind helping out but there's only so much to give while I'm also saving for a place of my own and I can't help but think that this could have all been avoided if she had just taken the vaccine??

In there, it says this:
‚ÄúThe largest sticking point was the lack of data on the effect boosters could have on young people, particularly because 16- and 17-year-olds weren‚Äôt included in the trial. Myocarditis, a heart inflammation condition, occurred mostly in young men, though very rarely, after their second mRNA dose, so members wanted to see more data on the effects of a third shot.‚Äù
So... the FDA now wants more data on how young men potentially can develop a heart condition after their second vaccine, so much so that it was ‚Äúthe biggest sticking point‚Äù for approving recommending these boosters...?

Due to the absolute mess of Brexit and other factors the UK government thinks that I still live there.
As the UK were quicker to dish out vaccines to my age bracket I flew back there to get my first jab. Shortly after, my resident country starting offering jabs so I got my second there.... job done. However, neither territory recognise the jab in the other as part of their own program which posed questions for my vaccine passport.
Luckily, since I had covid within the 6 months prior to my ""EU"" vaccine, the local government consider that I'm ""fully vaccinated"" and gave me my covid passport. Just in time for me to go on holiday üôÇ 
However, the UK (as in many other countries) still don't recognise a single vaccination as a ""full"" vaccination program, and I'm still not able to officialise these two jabs in different territories to prove that I've had both doses! 
So, since the local government were not offering me a second jab, I booked another one in the UK. I'm due to arrive there in two weeks to take it. However, last night I randomly went to a vaccination clinic to try my luck and actually managed to get a 2nd jab here!
So, after three doses, I finally have a full vaccine passport from the EU. Happy days.
...HOWEVER, I still have my appointment in the UK, and I'm wondering whether I just keep it and get a fourth vaccine!! It will mean I have two passports, which I guess is always better than 1!

None of my vaccinated friends and family members have the same issue and I can't find much about it on the internet (all articles I have read are talking about pain just after getting a vaccine not months after getting a vaccine). 
After I got my first dose of pfizer I pretty much didn't have any side effects, only soreness but that went away in a couple of days.

I had really high fever, my head hurt a lot, I had trouble with breathing and basically I felt like sh** for couple of days. I got better and everything was fine.

It has passed 2 months since my second dose and my arm still hurts. I don't really know how to describe the pain...

This time period was the same as the wait time between a 1st and 2nd dose. 
My symptoms were horrid, knocked me on my butt for 2 days. Fever chills muscle aches.. extremely swollen lymph node in my left armpit and pretty much felt like I was gonna die haha. So anyway the next month for my scheduled 2nd dose I skipped it.. they called in and I said no to it because I was scared the symptoms would be just as bad if not worse. I really was not trying to experience it again. I thought if my body reacted that strongly to the 1st one just like most people respond that strongly to the 2nd I didn't need the 2nd at all. I looked at some articles that said that people infected with Covid prior may not need a 2nd dose and decided F it I don't need it.
It's now September and I'm regretting not getting it because of the mandated vaxx cards.. I also heard the 2nd wasn't that bad for those infected with Covid prior as well. I couldn't even enter my school with just one dose on my card
My questions are is it too late to get the second dose? It's been almost 4 months üò≠ 
And I'm also wondering if the symptoms will be just as bad cos I waited so long.. has anyone gotten a delayed 2nd dose? And is there a way to specify my situation on my online vax card... Because my doctor stopped givin out the vaccines and I need to find some other place else soon! But I still need to go out before hand",2021-09-15,7,POST

122,popau7,Medical Exemption from Vaccine Mandate for Natural Immunity? Military Has Allowed It for Past Vaccines,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/popau7/medical_exemption_from_vaccine_mandate_for/,CovidVaccine,"Hey all,
This is not a political post and I'm genuinely interested to hear peoples' thoughts and opinions and didn't want to cause a sh\*tstorm by posting it on my personal FB. 
I've been thinking a lot lately (as many people have) if the so-called naturally immune / Covid-recovered could / would / should be exempt from the various vaccine mandates. As we have seen, various studies to varying degrees have seemed to show that there is pretty good immunity after recovery (there are opposite studies of course as well...we just don't have enough data yet to know for sure). Apart from all that though, I discovered that for military vaccine requirements - in general, pre-Covid - there has been allowed a medical exemption for ""Evidence of existing immunity"" - see screen shot below (taken from official US military site: [https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Clinical-Consultation-Services/Exemption-Guidance](https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Clinical-Consultation-Services/Exemption-Guidance)) .
My question for everyone is:  regardless of what the military is actually doing now regarding the Covid vaccine mandate, considering that natural immunity seemed to be a valid exemption in the past, for past diseases, should this still be a valid exemption for people today facing Covid vaccine mandates?

I really need your advice. I took the Pfizer vaccine back in June. The following morning I could not walk. My legs felt like they were 1000lbs. I ended up going to the urgent care. Of course, they down played it and mentioned that the vaccines are safe and that I probably always had that feeling in my legs. 
Fast forward a few days later. I started feeling intense pinching all over my body. It was horrible. In addition, sharp stabbing pains in my back. To top it off Charlie horses :(
I cried daily! Nothing helped with the pain.
I went to my primary care doctor who referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist called 911 immediately and told me that she suspects I have Gillian Barre Syndrome. Which can cause you to be paralyzed FYI. 
I went to the hospital and was admitted for a few days. There were lots and lots of test performed. In the end I had elevated levels of protein in my spine. Which confirmed that I did have Gillian Barre Syndrome. Everything else seemed fine.
FAST FORWARD 
I feel much better! No longer in pain. 
Here‚Äôs my problem:
My job has mandated the vaccine both doses must be taken within 45 days. I have only taken one dose. My neurologist says I can not take a second dose. My first dose was about 84 days ago. 
Options for work:
1. Go remote (there are no kids eligible for remote this year) who will I teach? 
2. Take the first and second dose within 45 days.

I got the 1st dose on the 16th of August and am left with a pretty weighty decision on whether to get the 2nd dose, which ultimately I will pose to the cardiologist that I will see a few hours before dose #2 and their opinion is most important. I REALLY want to get the 2nd dose if it will be safe for me.  
I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Marfan Syndrome, hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, possible autoimmune ulcerative colitis that will be investigated this month, a benign tumor on my pituitary gland, neurocardiogenic syncopy, brain lesions, probable MALS, endometriosis, mast cell activation syndrome, among other secondary problems and diagnoses. Basically nothing works right.  
I believe I am very high risk for covid and I absolutely do not want to catch it. After my 1st dose of the vaccine I had issues the first week which were to be expected, then 1.5 weeks later I started to feel horrible fatigue, very fluish, body aches, I had an increase in mast cell activation (heightened allergic responses) that was weird because it wasn't even mid September yet since that's when I usually get it.  
I had those along with dull achy pain under my left collarbone that would start at my front and go through to my back, sharp pain in the right side of my chest that sometimes would go from front to back, shortness of breath while lying down, low fever, in short I had all the symptoms of pericarditis, and possibly myocarditis. I have had weird heart stuff happen before (almost went into a heart attack during a routine test one week prior to the shot) so I went into this knowing this could happen to me, plus I tend to have inflammatory reactions to vaccines.  
Covid test I got done was negative.  
I have been communicating with my doctor and she told me to see a cardiologist before the 2nd shot. I am still pro-vaccine so this is a really hard decision for me. Nobody else I know has had adverse reactions to Pfizer or Moderna (I got Pfizer), not even the other sick people I know.

The ER & doctor don't know why and all my blood results came back fine. It seems like my blood sugar is dropping after I eat which is why I'm getting dizzy and I don't have diabetes, they literally checked everything.
I'm 40 years old, workout and run 5 days a week so I live a pretty healthy life with a good diet. Because of this I literally had to argue with my doctor to get him to take my blood test. They told me in 3 weeks the symptoms will go away it's been 4 weeks and some of the symptoms have reduced but the dizziness remains. I've had some people reach out to me on Instagram saying they experienced the same and they had to fast to reset their cells.
Update:
I've had quite a few people reach out to me who have experienced the same. You are not alone as many others are going through this and still are. What I have done to reduce the symptoms is eat low glycemic index foods, low carbs, adopted keto diet, eat between 10am and 6pm or 7pm and water fasted for 24 to 36 hours as needed which has reduced the symptoms significantly. Continue to boost your immunity and most important don't workout during this time. Listen to your body and when you feel better start with short walks. After my 24 hour water fast my heart rate/blood pressure started to come back down to normal, dizziness decreased, and I was able to start walking 1 mile a few days a week and on week two I've so far been able to walk 2 miles now comfortably. Don't get discouraged when you have days where the symptoms are starting to pick back up again. It's a slow progress and if you eat something that makes you super dizzy try to avoid that food and gradually work it back into your diet. At this point I would say I'm about 85% or 90% recovered just a few symptoms remaining.",2021-09-05,20,POST

I want to take the vaccine, though one thing that concerns me is the possibility of ADE, especially with future variants. I am young with no health issues. Most of my friends who contracted covid did just fine, however I know one person that is now struggling with long covid. So far from what I have read 10-15 percent of people seem to be somewhat affected by it though the data does not seem very clear so far. I also do not want to spread the disease to people that may are at risk.
What concerns me though as the title suggests is the possibility of ADE, especially since it has been observed with SARS Cov 1. 
Even though it has not been demonstrated with the delta strain so far it does not seem unlikely to happen in the future considering the fact that the virus is mutating rapidly and the vaccine does not prevent transmission, thus I think it is almost inevitable that escape variants are going to occur.
What makes me also hesitant is the fact that studies concerning the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the delta variant seem to show conflicting results. Some studies suggest an efficacy of about 90 percent, while the Israeli study suggest an efficacy of just about 60 percent. 
This poses also several questions. 
Could that be because vaccines were administered earlier in Israel and that the efficacy of the vaccine is waining over the course of just several months? 
Would that not require one then to take the vaccine every few months? Could regular vaccination not cause serious side effects? Would it still outweigh the risks associated with contracting the virus? Is delta associated with more severe disease outcomes? And how long does natural immunity last? Titres of antibodies decrease but it is not the only metric for immunity and as far as I know no studies were so far conducted concerning the T cell response of people who have been already exposed to the virus. 
So I am really on the fence of getting the vaccine, though I am absolutely no expert in this field. I would be very thankful, if someone knowledgeable could answer some of these questions or provide some resources perhaps.
Edit: I also consider waiting for the novavax vaccine ( which should be available in October/November  where I live), it seems to make ADE less likely since you are not only exposed to the s subunit of the spike protein, but create antibodies for the entire spike protein. This could be though complete bullshit and is just my hypothesis. I have as mentioned before no expertise in this.",2021-09-04,25,POST

150,pdzdkt,Heart issue after 6 days of the J&J vaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/pdzdkt/heart_issue_after_6_days_of_the_jj_vaccine/,CovidVaccine,"Hello guys! I had the J&J vaccine 23th August, 6 days ago, I am a 25 year old male, no health issues, was super into sports, I was really feeling at the peak of my health and overall physique and strenght, NEVER got sick in like 5 years since I worry alot about nutrition and exercise.
So I took the vaccine, now I am just feeling my heart really heavy, I lost some weight, I am really overall a complete mess, no energy at all. Could this still be vaccine symptoms? Even 6 days after? Wouldn't you guys think 6 days would be enough to get over it, or some people just take longer?
**But overall symptoms:**
\- Heart feels really heavy, any sort of too much stimulation just gives me this sickness in the stomach like its too much, I just have to be relaxed all times so it doesnt trigger any symptom, its the only way ive found comfort. Heart just feels weird overall.
\- Im just overall really weak, I cant project my voice properly, im just really weak overall. The heart issue is like my only symptom to be honest, which could be affecting the rest. Im just a total mess at the moment.
What would be your guys opinion on this? Could be the vaccine? Go to the doc? Wait a bit to see if it passes since its only been 6 days? Any clue what it could be also?
Thank you very much guys, even although I have only been 6 days like this, its already enough to appreciate what it is like to live healthy and without any issues, lets hope for the best",2021-08-29,11,POST

My circle is small, like 4 or 5 people, all of whom are fully vaccinated. I work with 2-4 people daily, but we are all naturally 15+ feet apart from each other. Typically we have shared spaces but never in them at  the same time.
My boss tested positive, I was told to quarantine until I could be tested (it came back negative) and I would not lose work time.
My friends, family and co-workers all accepted my reasons for postponing my vaccination when I told them. They know I am waiting to discuss things with my doctors.
Since the boss tested positive, I have been bombarded with texts and calls from those same friends and family essentially telling me to get the vaccine immediately. That it's better to be vaccinated with side effects than dead. That I, as an unvaccinated adult, am a risk to their children, even with all the precautions I take. 
I am struggling because I am still not comfortable (I haven't met with the doctors yet) with the vaccination, but I've always been the people-pleasing type.
Part of me thinks I should just do it so everyone will leave me alone. The other part of me thinks ""How dare they tell me to do something that I clearly am not ready to do. F them. They can't make medical decisions for me.""

I've had my first jab and plan on getting my second but was wondering if now that I'm (part) vaccinated, will that effect my body's natural production and ""quality"" of antibodies for covid 19. The level of antibodies from natural provided immunity seem to be higher after the same amount of time compared to the vaccine provided antibodies from what I have read and means in the future I will probably need to get more boosters. 
If I now catch covid after having the vaccine will I have the same strength of antibodies of someone who has never been vaccinated or now that I've started my vaccine protocol will I no longer have the opportunity to have long term strong/ high levels of antibodies seen in many unvaccinated covid survivors as the vaccine antibodies will be doing their job and not leaving my immune system to fend for itself?

Preface: My mum is against getting this vaccine. I have not had a vaccine since I was four. My mum doesn't believe in lockdowns or masks though, so honestly not sure I should be listening to her. She will let me get the vaccine because she believes in bodily autonomy, however, it means that I can't exactly discuss these things with her without being ridiculed. 
Pros of the vaccine: It is an ethical decision, I would be protecting those who are vulnerable, I would be able to travel freely within my country and around the world one day eventually, I want to be a doctor, so surely it's a given that I take it, I would be protecting myself.
Cons of the vaccine: I did a research project that vaccines take 7-17 years to develop, this has obviously not happened, although I know they have used existing technology. It doesn't appear to be fully effective, people are continuously needing boosters. I have also seen posts about it affecting periods, which is already something I struggle with. However, my biggest worry is that the long-term side effects cannot be known. For example, I would love to have children one day and this could affect my fertility.
I have tried ready medical journals and reports from the CDC and ATG but honestly, my scientific literacy isn't all there and I feel like I can't get the full picture with this. I have extreme anxiety, especially around health so if anyone could help aid either side of my internal argument that would be appreciated so much.",2021-08-22,5,POST

When googling nose bleeds and blood when wiping, I found long descriptions of 'thrombosis'. It doesn't seem to apply to me, no bruising, rashes, or red dots on the skin etc. Overall I felt fine after that first shot save for the 2 aforementioned items.

So I pushed through my anxiety yesterday and got vaccinated. I chose the J&J one simply because I waited too long and there were some things coming up soon that required vaccines that I didn't have weeks to prepare for. I went to this startup pharmacy in Brooklyn as opposed to a government-run place and only because they took appointments and guaranteed they had J&J.
I get jabbed, I hold it together and don't succumb to a panic attack, I leave, I'm fine all night except for this like an hour or two where my face muscles are super sore/tense and my left cheek twitched out a few times. Goes away after a bit. I wake up today and I feel absolutely nothing, maybe a minor headache and a little warm but I also didn't sleep super well. 
My anxiety is back a little over the thought that maybe they didn't actually give me a real vaccine. Crazy, I know. But I wanted to ask about something.  I didn't see the pharmacist pull a dose out of a vial. I never saw a vial or a fridge or anything. I just saw the syringe. Their workstation could have been on top of a minifridge but I didn't pay close enough attention. I wasn't in the best headspace so this memory could be tainted, but all I remember is the guy pulling the packaged syringe out of this red/orange container. Remember, I could have missed something due to my anxiety, but I'm 99.99% confident I didn't see him take a dose out of a vial. 
Can anyone describe to me the setups they saw at places they got vaccinated at? I'm not trying to peddle a huge conspiracy that I was given something deadly. At worst, I keep thinking about that nurse in Germany who gave her patients saltwater.",2021-08-21,5,POST

I am/was happy with it. 
But I am a teacher, and we are about to restart school face-to-face, which means I am about to come into close contact with hundreds of young people, who are mostly unvaccinated. I am ok with it, I have made my peace with that aspect of my job (most of us have). Nonetheless, I am/was still worried. I also have a family that I want to protect. 
So, following what is happening in some European countries, in San Francisco, and the opinion of several respectable experts  (Angela Rasmussen among them), I went ahead and got a shot of Moderna about 10 days ago, as a sort of ""booster"" for my one-dose JnJ. It all went well, and I didn't really experience any side effects, other than feeling a little tired (but I had run 15 miles the day before, so...).
Here is my question/hesitation: I have another appointment for my 2nd dose of Moderna during the 2nd week in September. Going through all the literature I could, I don't see any counterindication, but I also don't see any recommendation for it. Should I cancel the appointment and just stick to the one JnJ + 1 shot of mRNA (Moderna), or should I go ahead and get the 2nd Moderna shot? Has anyone done something similar?
Any informed advice or input is greatly appreciated.

Some of these are basic as I'm trying to have a better understanding as to how this process works from an individual with limited understanding in this field. I'd love it if those who respond could provide sources if possible. Will probably add more as I think of them. Thanks!
1. I've heard that mrna in general is very easy to destroy. How did these companies manage to encapsulate this in a delivery mechanism that does not destroy the mrna? What was it? 
2. How was the mrna developed? I know it was genetically engineered but how was the process done? What was it derived from?
3. All of the promotion of the vaccine mentions that the S-protein (spike protein) generated in the vax is harmless. How was this designed to be so?
4. How many Mrna's are encapsulated in the syringe?  
5. How much S-protein is generated during the transcription process? Since this was genetically engineered, have their been any documented cases where the amount failed to generate the 'x' number of S-proteins? Were their any negative effects as a result?
6. Assume the immune system isn't able to fight all of the S-proteins off, what happens then? Do they navigate to other parts of the body and cause potential harm? (*heard this technology shouldn't leave the site of injection*)
7. Is the Mrna tech just designed to create the s-protein, nothing else? 
8. Since the immune system has cells that are designed to attack invaders instantly, is it possible for the Mrna mechanism to be destroyed this way, before it even unravels to perform what it was designed to do?",2021-08-16,9,POST

I read 8 weeks between doses. Which is what I believe is the updated recommendation in the UK. My question is how much more protection does the longer intervals provide? Seeing as here in the US the interval is 3 weeks. Also waiting a longer time means you‚Äôre risking infection while you wait the longer intervals. So just wanted to ask advice on what you would do. 3 weeks or 8 weeks? Is the longer intervals worth it? * also of concern is that there‚Äôs no myocarditis pericarditis cases in UK with mRNA vaccines and the only difference is they have longer intervals. ** just read uk did have cases of myocarditis, pericarditis.

Looking to get some input on potentially getting 3 different Covid vaccines.  Here's the situation:
1. Girlfriend works in the Netherlands and ended up getting dose #1 of the AstraZenica vaccine.  Unfortunately when dose #2 became available, she had travel plans back to the US so never got dose #2
2. Upon her US stay with her family, she ended up getting the J&J vaccine at a very local, family owned pharmacy.  This was roughly 1-2 months ago.  Flew back to the Netherlands to get back to work.  
3. The Netherlands is requiring signed documentation regarding vaccinations in order to get it officially registered.  Unfortunately the documentation from the small pharmacy for her J&J vaccination isn't sufficient for the Netherlands requirements.
4. She's considering just getting a 3rd vaccine (Pfizer, both doses) just to have it officially registered with the Netherlands.
From my own research, there has been ""some"" research and data to show getting a 3rd vaccination type shouldn't be an issue but for me, the sample size is so small relative to the population as a whole that it's far from conclusive.  This is to be expected all reasonable things considered.  Still, I was wondering if any Redditors had any data or thoughts either way on getting a 3rd vaccination?",2021-08-09,3,POST

Now, to the meat of the question: Do I tell my parents, who are STAUNCHLY against the COVID vaccines, that I got vaccinated? The reasons they are against the vaccine are not just due to what they believe is a lack of effectiveness. For the record, they are not anti-Vaxxers in general‚Äîonly with the COVID vax. They believe every conspiracy they see online and believe that the government is using it to control us. They aren‚Äôt sure COVID is real, they theorize it‚Äôs just the flu and the numbers have been faked. They think the vaccine is the mark of the beast and that we‚Äôre in the end times. They believe that the vaccine makes you infertile and could be a form of population control. They also believe the vaccine is designed to weaken people so we will be easier to control and that the reason the unvaccinated are being segregated is so they don‚Äôt come together and ‚Äúfight back.‚Äù They believe that to get the vaccine, even in the name of protecting others, is to idolize the world over God and to ignore the warning‚Äôs He has given us.

I had COVID (likely Delta variant) 2 months ago.
It highly unlikely I contract Covid again. I am also generally not a high risk for complications from COVID. Now, since based on recent CDC data that states that Delta can be transmitted by vaccinated people almost as much as vaccinated people, my genuine question is: what is the incentive for me to get vaccinated? 
Real debate and critical, empathetic thought only, please. 
Considerations: 
1. I am not necessarily a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to others considering that vaccinated people pass Delta almost as much as non vaccinated people. (This consideration is directed at those who would say I should do it for the greater good‚Äî technically speaking, it doesn‚Äôt really have any impact whether I get vaccinated or not. A) I don‚Äôt pass Delta at a higher rate than a vaxxed person and B) vaxxed vs non vaxxed people may both pass new variants equally [what is happening with Delta]. We don‚Äôt know how the current vaccines protect against new variants)
2. I am not necessarily at risk to myself. I‚Äôve had COVID and, considering when and where, it was likely Delta. (This is for those who would say that I should get vaccinated in order to avoid hospitalization because vaccines lessen the d√©bete symptoms. A) I‚Äôve had Covid and B) I‚Äôm a healthy individual who in general is not high risk for Covid complications.)",2021-07-30,15,POST

I'm a medical student so whilst I'm on the more inexperienced end of the spectrum I have been taught about motivational interviewing and patient education. So here goes:
1. Encourage and support people asking for more information they're trying and being mean will more likely push them away 
2. Remember everyone has different life experiences and different areas of expertise. There is no need to penalise people for not knowing something
3. Give people the facts and links to reliable sources so they can read it for themselves
4. Listen to and acknowledge their concerns
5. Be kind and patient it goes a long way
[Here's](https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/ld/how-to-address-vaccine-hesitancy#h-discussing-vaccines-and-addressing-vaccine-hesitancy) an article discussing vaccine hesitancy and how to approach it if you want more details.

It's been a little  over two months from my second dose and I'm still having pain in my left  armpit and left side of my neck. It's not as bad as it was right after  the second shot but still a constant ache. I know it's from the vaccine  but still a little disconcerting.

I also understand the reason why it would be required. 
The problem is that my university makes it optional for all staff and faculty. This for me brings up many concerns and questions about the university and their leadership. I believe that it is either required for everyone or optional for everyone. So we the students are supposed to protect them as well as each other from getting sick, but they can't have them do the same for us? How are we supposed to respect any of the faculty or staff in that case.

Hello
Let me start by saying - this is NOT an anti-vaccine post . This is a post looking for help and advice.
Before vaccine - was healthy weight, frequently active around 3/4 times a week.
Female, 24 years old
After my first dose - hardly any symptoms - sore arm. life carried on as normal
On the 20th of April i got my second dose of the Pfizer - again sore arm.
within the next coming weeks my body started with loads of unusual symptoms:
Firstly i started experiencing flare ups on my face - neck, cheeks along with itching sometimes - i put this down to hormones' (never for a second thought that this would be down to the vaccine)
\- I contacted my GP - she said it was acne - prescribed differin.
Then i started having weird sensations on my face/neck - feeling warm/ redness/ itching/hives this started on my face and slowly progressed to my neck/chest. It would come and go - i would get also sharp dull ache all over these areas. ( I thought - maybe i was have allergic reaction to something?)
I started taking anti histamines - i started process of elimination. I drove myself insane - bleached my entire room, started changing my sheets daily because no matter what i seemed to do my symptoms become worse .
My mum started commenting that i look swollen 'i dont look myself' she would say.. i started becoming down.
I started feeling dizzy, fatigue and i fainted in work. My skin become worse despite trying everything, It become so itchy it was keeping my up at night.
Around 2 weeks ago a rash come up on my neck - my whole body started feeling inflamed, my ears started to itch, my head, my face! it was unbearable. Then i started waking up feeling numbness in my feet and hands.
i contacted my doctor - she said she believes I'm having an allergic reaction to something - she sent me for bloods / to check for diabetes, thyroids, iron/ blood count and prescribed me anti histamines
the last few days I've experienced pins and needles/numbness of my feet, hands, arms. I sleep with a wet cold flannel on my neck/face every night to relieve the itching .
There is no rash present on my face or neck anymore but my face/neck/ears have sensations that makes it so itchy. I still feel exhausted on a daily basis/ fatigue/ achy. I thought i was going crazy until i read others in the same situation.
Last night 13/07/21 - My whole body become hot like it has been the last few days - My whole body feels inflamed - I'm trying to explain this the best i can but it is very hard to explain because it is something i have never experienced.
I do not think i can live like this - I've read forums of others having some relief after taking Vitamin.
which i started to do so last night,
Can anyone help me? I am feeling low and dark thoughts because of how i am feeling.

I have a general feeling that they have a shortage of shots, because of the few appointments and how fast they end.
Spain uses the ones that are allowed in EU: Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/Lonza Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson&Johnson/Janssen.

262,oh0t5r,Numbness/Tingling - Persistent symptoms 1 one month after Pfizer Covid Vaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/oh0t5r/numbnesstingling_persistent_symptoms_1_one_month/,CovidVaccine," So  I'll start off by saying that I'm a nurse and am not anti-vaccine.  I  have no known pre-existing conditions, workout regularly, eat healthy,  and run marathons on occasion.
I  had Covid back in November 2020.  I was pretty sick, but recovered  quickly and felt much better after a few weeks.  Fast forward to June  4th, at which point I received my first dose of the Pfizer Covid  vaccine.  I felt like I had the flu a couple days and started to feel  better.  On June 7th, I told my husband that my feet felt like they were  falling asleep.  The next morning, it felt like my feet and calves were  both asleep/numb/tingling.  By afternoon, the tingling/numbness moved  up to my thighs and butt.  I went to the hospital at which point they  gave me every test under the sun thinking that I might have Guillian  Barre.
After a few days in the  hospital, they found that I had normal reflexes, a normal MRI, and  normal spinal fluid. At this point, Doctors felt confident that I didn't  have Guillian Barre and they sent me on my way with a follow up  appointment with a neurologist.  I was prescribed Gabapentin.
Once  back home, I felt extremely fatigued.  My legs remained numb and  tingling, but I tried to get along with my day normally.  I then started  to get random patches on my upper body that were extremely itchy,  mostly at night.  It sort of felt like bugs crawling on my skin.  I  started taking Gabapentin and Zyrtec, which helped a little but not  much.
The Neurologist ran a  plethora of tests including an EMG nerve test, which came out completely  normal.  I asked about Short Fiber Neuropathy, but the Doctor was  confident I didn't have that due to my symptoms being itching and not  burning or pain sensations.  The Neurologist seemed stumped, but  believed my symptoms were likely due to a severe inflammation response  to the vaccine.  He ran more blood test, but they didn't show any  inflammation.
So here I am, 5  weeks after my first vaccine and my symptoms haven't improved much if  any.  I feel like I have some of my energy back, but I'm not sure if  that is more me just pushing through it.  My entire legs remain  numb/tingling and I'm still frequently getting itching.  A few days ago,  I got an ache in my arm, but it went away after a couple days.
I've  been looking through Reddit and found a few post of people that have  had similar symptoms.  A few said they ""heard"" people started to feel  better after 6 to 8 weeks, but I haven't been able to find those posts.   Just wondering if anyone out there actually recovered from this  inflammation, because I'm starting to wonder if this is my new reality.   Interestingly enough, I've read that it takes nerves approximately 8 to  12 weeks to recover after injury, so I guess I'm still hoping it might  get better.  Thanks for any stories or advice.",2021-07-09,20,POST

I had no issues besides a sore arm with the first shot. 
After the second shot I had some insomnia and possibly a slightly elevated heart rate that came on about 10ish hours after I got my shot. But maybe lasted a few hours. Nothing alarming.

The next afternoon I started feeling like my heart was racing. It's been like that ever since along with slight chest heaviness, occasional stabbing feeling, and what feels like my heart skipping a beat every so often. I have a BP/HR monitor at home. My normal heart rate is around 70-80, my heart rate after the 1st dose has been 90 to 103.
Regarding the stabbing feeling, I tend to get this during allergy season. It's like a quick stab when I go to breath in and then I have to hold my breath for a bit and take shallow breaths until I can take a full breath without it hurting. This symptom could be unrelated to the vaccine.
I've been seeing a lot about myocarditis related to the vaccine and its making me nervous. I'm a bit hesitant to get the 2nd dose now.

I was just wondering if any of you allergic people had their symptoms worsen right after getting their covid vaccine.
I got my 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday and experienced a WAY worse PMLE rash (sun allergy) than usual. My allergy was under control thanks to antihistamines and I barely got any spots the past few weeks. Went to the sun for like 30 minutes after getting the vaccine yesterday and woke up with a rash on my chest (plus some awful side effects from the vaccine like chills, body ache, fatigue). 
Do you think the immune reaction to the vaccine could have temporarily worsened my sun allergy?

I became dizzy and lightheaded. I told the nurse and she said it was normal lymph reaction so I waited an hour then drove home. For the next MONTH, I had a fever between 99.3 - 99.6, the ear pressure, dizziness that turned into vertigo, big hot flashes and insatiable hunger (I usually have appetite problems). This went on for so long that I thought I was pregnant. After 2.5 weeks, I went to the emergency room. They did every test they could thinking it could be a thyroid issue since the symptoms seemed hormonal but all counts were normal! So now I have a $2k hospital bill for something I was told was safe and effective. Obviously, I skipped the second shot.
Fast forward 3 months. I now have tiny red spots popping up all over my body. Sometimes they itch, sometimes I feel nothing. They look like insect bites or hives, but I've seen no bugs and I keep checking! I have read about skin conditions like this related to the vaccine but haven't heard anything in person. Dermatologist appointment is scheduled (more $$$) and I can update if I get a clear diagnosis.
My friend, 25/F that got Moderna had a similar hormonal reaction. She has endometriosis, and had awful cramps along with the dizziness and huge increase in appetite. Didn't have a period for two months after. I know most adverse effects have been in pre-menopausal women, and I think that estrogen may be playing a part in the mRNA reactions.
Does anyone have experience with this? Has anyone found answers from a doctor? I really wish I hadn't taken the shot. I understand the need for it and that covid was an emergency but this only took 10 months to develop! No way that could be safe for everyone.

I have a theory surrounding this treatment, using 10mg CBD oil with at least 0.1% THC, with one dose of 10mg CBD oil, taken every 8 hours for 10 days, reversing both Covid and Long Covid symptoms. 
Currently I am trying to finalise a paper I am writing, on what I learned, which has increased difficulty for myself, as I am using examples from other fields as I am not in the medical field and more experienced on conservation, environmental solutions and an amateur Climate scientist.
So can I get your help, which may also help others exploring the way these vaccines are helping or not and what side effects if any are present.  
As currently a lot of the flow of i formation is being maliciously censored, including the very real documents like this Freedom of Information requested information to the Japanese Government.  Who shared this not for public release document on the testing of the Pfizer Moderna vaccine, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v1
In my own paper, from exploring the quirks I experienced, including some damage caused quirks that may be explained by the Guillain-barre Syndrome, which is similar to a disease of the central nervous system I suffer from called Fibromialja, which some of the symptoms of Guillain-barre syndrome, I saw in my own infection and with news of at least 4 persons who were vaccinated developing the syndrome, I am more curious and having it investigated as to why my Fibromialja appears gets particularly bad during and following the covid infection. 
As for the areas of my paper, it‚Äôs my belief that the bone marrow, along with the genitals become infected with the Spike Proteins from the virus, where the blood in the body takes on a liquid Jelly like appearance (Jelly in British English is Jam in American), with more blood being produced from the bone marrow in the skeleton, producing more of this Jelly like blood.  
Which would logically explain away the quirks I have seen when I cut myself by accident and, played with some of that blood and blood plasma, that looked like white blood cells also in my body, we know as mucus / snot. 
So could you please comment if you have had any adverse reactions to the vaccines, please be honest and if you have to make a joke or be sarcastic in your reply, just know I don‚Äôt get sarcasm, and if you can put (no) before putting something down if you are just joking about.

I appreciate anyone taking the time to reassure me. Long story short, I think this anxiety began because my partner doesn't want the COVID vaccine. He feels the technology is too new and wants to wait. For a long time I tried to convince him to get it, but gave up. I got my first dose of Pfizer a few weeks ago. Recently, as I tried to understand my partner's point of view, I found myself going down the ""intellectual dark web"" rabbit hole. 
Mainly, stuff from people like Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, the other Weinstein and then these doctors who are against it like Geert Vanden Bossche and one of the people behind the mRNA technology, Dr. Robert Malone...has me suddenly incredibly anxious. I feel at war with myself. I want to be logical and think, nah, these folks are phony, ignore it, ignore it. Yet the recent discovery that the lab leak hypothesis (which these same folks were also talking about quite early) could be true has me questioning myself. There's a nagging voice in my head, like, what if there's a chance this could have long term effects or is dangerous??
I'm sincerely sorry if sharing my anxiety causes any anxiety to anyone else. Again, I'm embarrassed to admit it's getting to me. Talk of suppression of information, some Japanese data or FOIA request, the effect on fertility, there are a million different little things it seems, which are likely conspiratorial but I just feel so anxious suddenly.

Him having them is making me question possibly just taking one, filling it in, and faking it to my boss so that I can actually breathe at my job, especially since where I live, northern Oregon USA, has really humid summers and this is possibly gonna kill me in a mask. My dilemma in doing this is, how does the state know who got vaccinated and who didn‚Äôt? If my boss called Walgreens or Rite Aid or wherever I write on the card, to check and confirm that I got it, could they access that information? I‚Äôve heard that they can‚Äôt, that it‚Äôs your private medical records. Here‚Äôs the final kicker, but certainly in no way my motivation - my boss is offering a $200 bonus for getting it, and he takes a picture of the card and sends it to the government. I know that he‚Äôs getting reimbursed from the government for offering an incentive. Does that verify anything? Once I fill in the card, I had thought of calling my doc to add it to my medical records to make it seem more legit, but I don‚Äôt know if they (docs) verify that I actually got it either. 
I know how I sound right now, but getting the shot is just not an option. It goes against my beliefs and I honestly really don‚Äôt need it. Any positive advice is appreciated, and if you are going to tell me how terrible I am, etc., please just move along. Either way (getting it or faking it), my morals are compromised here, but what I do know is that I can‚Äôt go this summer not breathing. That‚Äôs what I do know for sure. I might need to job hunt, but I would rather not....",2021-06-14,8,POST

I am just looking for more information to deal with the side effects.
I received my first dose of Pfizer a week ago today. Everything went smoothly aside from the pain in my arm. I also felt slight confusion as I caught myself putting a my pen cap on a plastic container instead of the small lid. That night my insides started to feel like they were about to melt, but I ignored it for a few days as I read online that it was expected to feel unwell after the shot.
A couple of days ago (5 days after I received the shot), I realized my energy level was at about 20%. I needed help getting up from the sofa and had no appetite. I am still feeling extremely weak and I feel my brain is operating at 50% capacity. I have swollen lymphs and clammy skin, but no other major side effects.
Has anyone else had similar experiences and how long did it take for them to go away? I dragged myself into the clinic this morning for a COVID test just in case, but I am pretty certain this is due to the shot. I have looked everywhere for details on why this is happening and how often people have had a similar experience to no avail.",2021-06-09,13,POST
323,ntxrb4,Vaccinated 4/2/21 & 5/6/21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/ntxrb4/vaccinated_4221_5621/,CovidVaccine,"Hello Reddit community that has come here for vaccine news. I would first like to start this post by saying that I am pro-vax. But I am going to express some worries and concerns. It is important that you understand I am not posting this to scare you, I am only posting my experience and wonder if I can connect with people in my situation. I wasn't having any health complications prior to the vaccine and I am a 23 year old relatively health male.
I was vaccinated 4/2/21 with Pfizer. No immediate side effects besides a really sore arm. About 2 weeks later, I started experiencing random bruising on my arms. I was really worried because I had read that these were common side effects for the AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson vaccines. I spoke with my doctor but by the time I could be seen two weeks out, my bruises started to fade away. The following weeks I experienced symptoms of tight throat, hard to swallow, and deep pain in my left arm that received the shot. The only way I could describe it was as if my veins were hardening and were really stiff. Of course, seeing my doctor took another 2 weeks where I hadn't experience the symptoms since and so my doctor shrugged it off.. (thanks America for creating a capitalist health care system where doctors don't care unless they can make a pretty dollar off of you)
The days leading up to my second shot I was experiencing chest pains, so my doc ran an EKG on me and said everything was normal besides a fast heart rate. Now my car wouldn't start the morning of my second vax and well I wondered if it was the universe telling me something. Going against my gut feeling, made another apt and got my second shot just to get it all over with. Immediate side effects I felt a bit feverish the day after and that was all. However, the week following I started experiencing facial numbness... 
So at this point I am not going to lie. I am extremely scared and worried about my health. My better judgement is saying not to post this because it could be a totally separate disease at work that is unrelated to the vaccine. However, because I was healthy and fine before I am worried that maybe the vaccine might've triggered something in my body. Anyways back to my experience, along with this numbness, I experienced this tingling in my back and other parts of my body. My digestive system also suddenly has been in a funk, I've been constipated and going diarrhea like I have never before. 
I went to my doctor expressed my concerns. I requested an MRI because I have been feeling aches and pains like I never have before. My doctor said my insurance wouldn't approve it unless I am practically dead (and he would bet his salary on that). He did end up putting a referral in for me for a cardiologist (for the chest pains), neurologist (for the facial numbness), and finally a hematologist/oncologist to address some discrepancies in my blood work. 
I am honestly prepared for the worst at this point. My doctor has no idea whats going on with me but cant order an MRI for me which would probably be very telling if he could. I am not sure if any of this is linked to the covid vaccine or if m very rare instance it is. But I felt it necessary to share my experience because it has been one that has been causing me to lose sleep. My health anxiety is at an all time high, which has just been exaggerating my symptoms very much. Cognitive distortion has really been taking over my thoughts. I want to pay out of pocket for an MRI, but that could cost anywhere between 2k-5k which I don't have but at this point I feel like I have no choice.
If any of all had a similar experience or know of anyone who has DM me! If any one has any information on how I could possibly get a cheap MRI somewhere DM me! Lastly, kind words only I cant take any more stress or negativity. I promise I am not trying to spread fear, this just has been my experience.",2021-06-07,19,POST

I don't know how Pfizer came up with, ""Dose 1 is 50% effective, dose 2 is 95%"", but they must've checked for efficacy a week after the 1st dose while the immunity was still mounting.
There is no way three weeks after dose 1 protection is at 50%. Look at the chart.

That was until I sat down. 2 minutes in I felt painful muscle cramps and odd dizziness. I drank water. 5 minutes in the dizziness started to fade and I could focus on my arm pain, which felt like it was sucking itself into the muscle.
Everybody told me it would be a normal shot, like the flu. But even now I'm still having some mild arm cramps. My next shot will be on the 24th. I refuse to go.

After a week and a half I went to a clinic for migraine medicine and the doctor said she could not prescribe it without an MRI. I decided to wait it out and look online to see if anyone else experienced this. Some article mentioned the cause being neuro inflammation. 
Decided to take some curcumin (tumeric) pills to see if it could help by reducing inflammation. The pain and pressure slowly dulled out within two days of taking the curcumin. 
A friend recommended this to her roommate who was having the same side effects for two months. Her roommate thanked me a few days later because the curcumin was helping her. I‚Äôm glad it helped her and also find it interesting to know it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence on my end. 
I‚Äôm not a doctor nor one of those essential oils people and I do believe in modern medicine. Just have an asian dad that has been trying to get me to take tumeric for two years.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a lot of anecdotal reports,‚Äù says Dr. Dan Shade, a sleep specialist at the Allegheny Health Network. ‚ÄúThe literature really doesn‚Äôt support this right now, but it‚Äôs early.‚Äù
After immunization, or with a COVID infection, or just during the pandemic in general, Dr. Shade says his patients have commented on bizarre dreams.
‚ÄúAlong with a lot of viral or serious illnesses, is that it really affects the sleep wake cycle,‚Äù he explains.
He doesn‚Äôt have a precise explanation, but guesses it has something to do with poor sleep from the anticipation of side effects.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre expecting to experience fever, muscle pain, headache and they‚Äôre probably not sleeping well,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe most common reason we remember dreams is our sleep is disrupted.‚Äù
Whether the immune response is reacting with brain cells, it‚Äôs too soon to say.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to look back on the data years from now, and you know what, these dreams weren‚Äôt just PTSD, there was actually a physiologic cause for it,‚Äù says Dr. Shade.
If a booster dose is needed in the future, the intense dreams won‚Äôt stop Richard. ‚Äù
Ventilator versus feeling a little bad, a bad dream. I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôll take that tradeoff,‚Äù he says.
Severe illness with COVID would be the bigger nightmare.

386,nffgn7,Covid vaccines for the non-vulnerable make no sense due to it being an evolving disease like the cold,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/nffgn7/covid_vaccines_for_the_nonvulnerable_make_no/,CovidVaccine,"Covid differs from Smallpox, measles, polio and other diseases for which we have vaccines in that it rapidly evolves and develops new strains. Covid can now be regarded as endemic in the world. It makes sense for vulnerable people to get vaccinated if they don't yet have some immunity to Covid, but there is some indication that vaccinating non-vulnerable people may be unnecessary and actually add to the health burden of nations:
(i) Over-vaccination of the population could lead to new Covid strains evolving to find ways around the effectiveness of current vaccines.
(ii) There are unknown long-term effects. These vaccines are still experimental.
(iii) Short term adverse reactions to the vaccine are putting additional   strain on health services, e.g. many people in the UK are attending hospital with severe headaches or other concerning symptoms following vaccination. Side effects leading to death or serious illness are rare, but the need to be cautious in response to adverse reactions is putting pressure on doctors and hospitals.
(iv) T-cell long term immunity, as with SARS from 2002, is likely contributing to herd immunity in addition to the vaccination program, mitigating the need for the non-vulnerable to be vaccinated.
(v) Given that the vulnerable are currently suffering from Covid in e.g. India, and doctors in developing countries are dying, should we not be redirecting all vaccines through the COVAX program before vaccinating the non-vulnerable in richer nations, e.g. the UK and US, where the   vulnerable populations have already largely been vaccinated?
(vi) There is not yet sufficient evidence that the vaccines reduce transmission, or understanding of the mechanism by which they would do so. They don't produce the same kind of immune response in the lungs that natural immunity produces to reduce transmission. If however, as some studies show, they reduce transmission via another mechanism (e.g. less viral load being detected in the nostrils), then that would indicate that Covid cannot be transmitted by asymptomatic cases which also have very low viral load (the majority of the cases diagnosed in   young people). Therefore, if the vaccines reduce transmission as a result of reducing viral load, then asymptomatic transmission was never a thing in the first place, and vaccines for children and young adults are therefore unnecessary. If the vaccine does not reduce transmission, then vaccines for the non-vulnerable are also unnecessary due to non-vulnerable people having such a low probability of developing illness due to Covid.
With static diseases, it is important for non-vulnerable to get vaccinated to protect the more vulnerable who can't be vaccinated, but that is not the case for coronaviruses which evolve more rapidly. Future strains of Covid will naturally become as harmless as a cold within the near term,   but could this be compromised by over-vaccination of the population?
I'd be interested to know your thoughts on the above, and please let me know if there is a better placed forum to raise these points/ask these questions. Thanks.",2021-05-18,17,POST

So, for starters the CDC states that having the covid vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get it, so this means you still get covid if you have the vaccine and I‚Äôve seen plenty of cases myself of this happening so this is a fact that you can get covid while being fully vaccinated. On top of that the CDC also states that you can still infect others of you have the vaccine and have covid. SO, why would they be saying that it‚Äôs okay to not wear a mask if you are vaccinated when in fact having the covid vaccine does not prevent you from getting covid or transmitting it to others. Am I the only one who finds that inconspicuous?? Because the only logic that I find out of that is covid is not as bad as it has been portrayed to be and we have been lied to. Now I ask most people about the vaccine they think they are no longer harming society and they think they are saving lives because of the vaccine but in reality the only life they are saving is their own and nobody else‚Äôs. Based on exactly what the CDC says, the vaccine is something that is only self beneficial so you don‚Äôt die if you have covid. This would also mean that all of the covid vaccinated vs non vaccinated rules do absolutely nothing except discriminate those who have gotten the vaccine vs those who have not

I didn't care all that much about getting the vaccine until a recent discussion about letting people not wear masks if they've got their second shot. This only bothers me because whether you've gotten your second shot or have been infected, it has the same outcome. You have antibodies both ways.
Just to clarify I'm not an anti-vaxxer or believe the vaccines are dangerous or anything. I have no problem with the vaccine and I think it has helped a lot.

I have weird situation regarding the vaccine and I wanted some advice. For context: I am generally am pro-vaccine, I think they are a good thing and we should be getting them, even making them mandatory in some cases. I my self am fully vaccinated despite multiple issues with doctors and poor vaccine practices, and still think it was the correct choice though it may be not have been handled well by my parents. My mother is what you would call a ""Google Doctor"" and my father historically does not care about opinion on anything medical and will trust anything in a white coat without any scrutiny.
This is where the Covid thing comes in. I DO NOT believe the vaccine is unsafe. It doesn't make sense for it to be, because if it was these companies that provides are ef\*\*\*\*\*d so bad. They would be lucky to not have a business and more likely would end up persecuted for malpractice etc. I will most likely get the vaccine in due time.
However, I want to wait. My reason being that from my research the vaccine is known to last about 6-8 months. Which leads me to believe that this is a stop gap measure, as if this is the only vaccines ever created it would become a bi-yearly thing which I'm not very okay with doing. for personal reasons. The spreads of variants are concerning as well, as this is a virus similar to the flu and mutations are inevitable. I want to know what the long term solutions are before making the step. I also want to see more about edge cases in these vaccines which we will only be able to see with many many people of different types getting vaccinated. I my self am in a weird group where I could be asymptomatic, but I could also have a bad reaction to it due to sensitive lungs. Which currently seems like the vaccine can trigger as well (though you cannot get covid from it, the process of making the antibodies can product covid-like symptoms), so I'm worried about my reaction to the vaccine being more pronounced. On top of this I work from home (permanently), and I'm about to make a move to the cow-filled-rural part of Texas where the spread is very low. Meaning I am not overly exposed to others.
My parents have been hounding and guilt tripping me with every bit of information they can find. Its has gotten to the point that the more I hear about it from them, the less I feel open to talking about it with them and more I want to wait. Even though that is a very irrational response on my end. I am so tired of it, and I can't even rebuttal without them pulling the ""you should trust us we know everything"" attitude. Combined with them believing my boyfriend is the devil and they blame him for everything, (He is not, he is just a veteran from being medic in the military so he likes guns and tends to be more skeptic of authority than they are) the tension is really stressful. I know they mean well and they are just worried, but at the same time I feel so attacked by everyone and my own parents for just wanting some time to collect, research, and process, that its become an issue for my mental health. 
I really need some advice on how to talk to them about it. Perhaps information or sources I can provide, or examples to give. Or even just knowing I'm not as absolutely insane about not being 100% on board with these vaccines.
Thank you all in advance for any advice you give me.",2021-05-14,21,POST

5/25/21 UPDATE: This post is 10 days old.  The only reaction I had was a sore/stiff arm.
Make sure you drink LOTS of water before your shot and after.  Avoid sugary/carbonated drinks and crappy foods before and right after (it'll help keep you from feeling blah).  Try to do arm exercises to cut down on the stiffness and sore arm.  Absolutely no allergic reactions occurred at all.  I get my second dose on June 4th and I'll update a few times after that one as well!

EDITED TO ADD‚Äî I got my shot at 3:30 pm yesterday. As of now it has been 18 hours and I‚Äôve had no allergic reaction symptoms at all. The only side effects I‚Äôve had thus far are a slightly sore/stiff arm.

My parents have said that there are other strains of covid that have the potential and more likelier to injure/ kill younger people. Also that it helps everyone get back to normal if we all get vaccinated.
I feel like the only thing really motivating me to get this vaccine is fear of being judged by the people who believe everyone should get it. I‚Äôm not against vaccinations, I just know that I could potentially induce covid symptoms by getting this vaccine whilst never even feeling it throughout the pandemic. I do not see a reason as to why I need to get this. 
Plus the long term effects of this new vaccine are not known. Why even take a chance when I‚Äôm a healthy person who takes care of themselves? I‚Äôm worried I will get this vaccine just because of fearing the reactions of saying no.

These heart palpitations have made me think I am going die on multiple occasions. I know that's crazy but when you get like 10 intense palpitations in a row it makes me wonder if my heart is going to go back to normal or if im just going to pass then and there. I can handle the isolated palpitations, but when the heart isn't refilling in-between it's so scary, affects my breathing and makes me anxious. The doc has ordered a whole lot of tests and now we are just waiting on the results. I have started to take magnesium and calcium to try relieve the heart palpitations.

463,n2uhz2,Pfizer 1st shot - anxious person,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/n2uhz2/pfizer_1st_shot_anxious_person/,CovidVaccine,"Hi all,
I just got my 1st Covid shot (Pfizer) and wanted to post my experience. I am a very anxious person, I have been battling generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks for 13+ years. Part of my disorder is a very severe health anxiety/hypochondria. Prior to scheduling my dose and the days leading up to it, I went on Google and on here to see others' experiences. Seeing good stories helps ease my fears. However, I noticed that a lot of the stories were from those folks who didn't have a good time (sorry guys! Not fun!!), and barely any were of good/positive experiences. So i want to put mine here to give hope to anyone like I was... so far its gone fine.
4/27: scheduled my appointment for 1st and 2nd doses, after months of avoiding it. Took an hour to decide the best time and day to do it, to allow me time to recover from my anxiety without any obligations. Took minutes to actually schedule, and was able to see which vaccine brand was available where (i did cvs; was nervous about j&j and moderna). 10/10
4/27-4/30: my nervous tick was back. Between the anxiety of knowing I had it scheduled, the anxiety of finals coming up in a week, and the anxiety that ways comes right before my time-of-the-month. But was able to manage it. Have been drinking tons of water for the last 4 days, so much so that my pee has been straw-colored to clear. Not drowning in water but drinking it steadily throughout each day.  9/10
5/1: the day arrived. I worked a double today so I was able to distract myself. Had 2 great shifts so I was in a great mood. Then the shift got closer to the end and I knew my appt time was nearing. Began to have a nervous stomach (the shits). Not fun, but manageable. 8/10
5/1: 4:00pm got home from work. Ate lunch, drank tons of water. Had absoluty no appetite. The panic attack starts. At this point, slightly elevated heart rate, cold sweats, slightly shaky, can't focus, and irritable. But used to this feeling. 8/10
5/1: 4:55 pm we head out the door to cvs. The panic attack slowly increases. I had my boyfriend drive me because i knew it would be safer. 8/10 because I know this is JUST panic
5/1: 5:13 pm we are 2 minutes away. Dry mouth sets in. 7/10
5/1: 5:15 pm we get into cvs. I start crying from the panic attack. Luckily my bf is there to help check me in and hold my hand. The woman checking me in is SUPER nice when she sees me crying. 7.5/10
5/1: 5:20 pm I sit down for my shot. I am so thankful that I was seated with an RN (was happy to have a med professional and not just a tech or student) there, and she was a psych RN for 20 years. I felt calm with her, but panic attack was still there. She asked me the regular questions: name, dob, allergies. I have allergies to 2 meds so she tells me ill stay there for 30 mins (so happy). I'm shaking, heart is racing, crying, lightheaded, legs shaking. 5/10 for the panic attack but 14/10 for the nurse
5/1: 5:25 pm she has me turn away so I don't see it. She gives me the shot. The shot itself feels like getting any vaccine. 10/10
5/1: 5:26 pm my panic attack immediately gets worse. Again, just a panic attack because I've felt all these symptoms before AND right before I got the shot. No change in symptoms just heightened. Shaky legs and hands, shaky chest, lightheaded, short of breath, racing heart, fear 6/10
5/1: 5:26-5:40 pm the nurse is so kind and my boyfriend rubs my back and his hand on my knee to keep me grounded (it works guys!!). She just has conversation to keep my mind off the panic while waiting for it to finish. She has me sitting on the ground. Let's me take my mask off to eat a Granola bar that I had in my purse. Drinking tons of water. 7/10
5/1: 5:45 pm start to feel better. She has me walk around. I feel immediately nauseas so I sit back down. It's from the panic, eating, and chugging water. I spit up a bit then feel better. 8/10
5/1: 5:50 pm I'm able to sit in a chair. I get up to pee. Making the walk to the bathroom and using the bathroom helps. Something about the act of urinating sometimes feels like I'm washing out my panic. 8.5/10
5/1: 6:30 pm we get home. Feels good to finally be home. I lay in bed. Arm is just now starting to be sore, just like with my flu shot so nothing extreme. Feels like I got punched by a human (have seen people say they felt like they were punched by a horse, lol). 9/10
5/1: 630-7:40 pm have been laying in bed since I got home. I have frasier playing in the background to distract my thoughts. Scrolling through pinterest to soothe my thoughts. Have peed like 4 times already (I had a lot of water). Bored, but enjoying time to lay down with no obligations. Might get delivery for dinner. No headache yet. 9.5/10
UPDATE:
5/2: 9am trouble sleeping over night, kept waking up and when I woke up I was having chills and sweating. No fever. Arm was very sore but I just moved it around and used it and the soreness went away. 8/10
5/2: 9am-3pm felt feverish but not achey. Highest temp i had was 98.9 at 3pm. Forehead was hot and I had a heat rash on my chest. 7/10
5/2: 3:30 pm felt like feverish feeling was going away. 9/10
5/2: 8pm back to normal, just some lingering anxiety 10/10
5/3: slept through the night, mo night sweats. Feeling fine. Arm just feels tender at the injection site only if I push very hard on it. Feels like I worked out. 10/10
Tl;dr - have a history of anxiety and panic attacks. Had my 1st dose on 5/1 @ 5:15 pm. So far have only had panic attack before the shot that was heightened immediately after. Went away within the hour. Only slight soreness, can still use my arm. No fatigue. Felt feverish but didn't have an actual fever. Back to normal 27 hours after my shot. 
**tip: get at the end of the day or on a day you have nothing to do
**tip: get in the arm you don't sleep on!! And move it around.
**tip: if you are feing anxious, it is normal. The nurse who gave me my shot told me she had 4 other people before me who freaked out. COMMUNICATE your feelings and know YOU ARE NOT ALONE. And PRACTUCE DEEP BREATHING or BOX BREATHING.

The only side effects I've had for both doses were mild nausea and appetite loss. I was even doing some heavy lifting afterwards without issue. 
Some advice that has helped me a lot: 
-my nurse for the first shot said to  c o m p l e t e l y   relax my arm, so I did, and maybe that's why I didn't have much soreness. (Did the same for the second dose, but my nurse didn't prompt me to that time)
-stay off subs like this. The number of people posting negative experiences will far far far outweigh those who had an uneventful one.
-Listen to doctors. it takes about eight years to get a medical degree. If you didn't complete eight years of formal study, but still think you somehow know better than tens of thousands of doctors from around the globe, maybe it's time to google ""how to find reliable information sources"". I know that sounded snarky, but i meant it sincerely; I went to a suburban middle school in a well funded district and still remember my 6th grade unit on how to find good sources of info, and there actually is a firm method for it.",2021-05-01,22,POST

I meant to say...
So I am sure many of you have heard a lot of different personal stories about the vaccine, and have seen articles as of recently about how the Covid vaccine may be affecting periods. I am still on the fence about the vaccine and just wanted to see what some other opinions were about this. I want to get pregnant later this year, and am still in the fence about the vaccine. Not getting vaccinated affects my ability to travel and visit certain places, so just weighing the risks vs. the benefit. Otherwise I‚Äôm young and healthy and not scared of getting Covid personally.

I've been studying the relation between this new MRNA Vaccine and a possible relation to Prion diseases such as : Alzheimers Disease and ALS . 
There's not a whole lot of evidence or literature regarding this concern, as the vaccine is new and long term side effects are unclear. But i believe there should be more studies and an open discussion about the possibility of such serious side effects. The information I was able to find, was very confrontational. There were a lot of interesting points coming from both sides. But the resounding opinion was that it's more unlikely for such a mutation to occur from the vaccine. 
But personally I am still interested in delving deeper into the subject and would like to hear your thoughts. These are pretty intense accusations, and very serious diseases.
There is plenty of literature apposing the idea of this new mNRA vaccine causing these diseases to occur, but I recommend seeking out literature solely based on mNRA and and the relation to Prions Diseases and how mNRA's effect/change the protein of your cells.

The issue, however, is that we‚Äôve both felt mildly dizzy ever since. We‚Äôre still able to function, work, and go to the gym, but it‚Äôs just a nagging dizziness feeling as if our equilibriums are slightly off. Also, mildly fatigued on and off. 
This is not accompanied by shortness of breath, headache, leg pain, or chest pain, so I don‚Äôt think clotting is the issue. Scheduling a doctors appointment for next week regardless, but is anyone else having long term effects from J&J? Can‚Äôt find anything online about it.

If a mutation causes that portion to change enough, there will no longer be an immune response to the new variant.
So omicron, with many mutations of the triggering component used in  the original vaccines, leaves a (mRNA) vaccinated individual relatively unprotected.
That's why naturally immune (infection recovered) people generally have a much lower risk.  Their immune systems were ""trained"" using the whole virus, and even after many mutations, some of the original components may still be present and trigger a (muted) response.
Even when the mutations are significant enough to cause a naturally immune person to be reinfected, there may still some residual components that elicit an immune response that lessens the severity of a reinfection.  This also gives their immune system an opportunity to update its response with the mutated portions of the new variant.

COVID infection causes a pan-vasculitis or an inflammation of the blood vessels leading to clots and fibrosis. If this occurs in the developing placenta as it implants, then that would increase the risk of miscarriage.
Im an OB/Gyn and have seen several patients with a history of health pregnancies, struggle with repeat miscarriage after getting COVID while unvaccinated. Al though this is just my anecdotal evidence, several researchers are starting to note an increase in miscarriages in this population as well.

My fiance and I (both of us haven't gotten the covid vaccine) went to a Christmas party, in which most of the people there did get the covid vaccine. Roughly 7-8 out of 20 people got covid, while we did not, so your stats are way off. We also got covid in October 2020, and the sickest we've been since has just been sinus and allergy issues. We know what the common cold and flu is like, what sinus and respiratory colds and infections are like, and we know what covid is like. You know when cold and flu season comes around, and you hardly ever get sick, and when you do, you have minor symptoms and you're good within a couple days? It's because your body has built an effective immune system and has the proper means to fight off sickness. In certain areas of getting sick, natural immunity is king.
Edit to add: my fiance's step son-in-law, is 22 years old, no prior health issues, no pre-existing conditions, etc. He got the Pfizer vaccine and he had sudden heart issues and had to undergo surgery.

July 2021 and was 16.9% at that time among patients of 60 years and older []. This proportion is increasing week by week and was 58.9% on 27. October 2021 (Figure 1) providing clear evidence of the increasing relevance of the fully vaccinated as a possible source of transmission.
‚Ä¶
In Israel a nosocomial outbreak was reported involving 16 healthcare workers, 23 exposed patients and two family members. The source was a fully vaccinated COVID-19 patient. The vaccination rate was 96.2% among all exposed individuals (151 healthcare workers and 97 patients). Fourteen fully vaccinated patients became severely ill or died, the two unvaccinated patients developed mild disease. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies four of the top five counties with the highest percentage of fully vaccinated population (99.9‚Äì84.3%) as ‚Äúhigh‚Äù transmission counties. Many decisionmakers assume that the vaccinated can be excluded as a source of transmission. It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.‚Äù [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00258-1/fulltext?s=08)",2022-01-22,8,COMMENT

Have you looked at the policies in place, the impact of the delta variety (which I'm pretty sure everyone admits that the vaccine isn't as useful for)? What was your analytical process for determining that the vaccine did not work? Notice that you didn't look at vaccinated deaths and hospitalizations but just (presumably since you didn't specify) the total number?

The people who traditionally require the most medical care are the ones who are really the incubators for the variants. Immunocompromised people. Like me. A virus passing from one vaccinated person to another vaccinated person doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of time, and therefore chance, to mutate. It‚Äôs when it hits someone like myself. I‚Äôve had two Moderna shots and I‚Äôll get the booster as soon as it is available in my area again. The amount of antibodies I‚Äôve gained from those two shots is very small. So let‚Äôs say I get smacked in the face with Delta. Much higher odds that I‚Äôm going to be seriously ill and as close to certain as can be that I‚Äôll be significantly more ill than a normal person. So it gets to sit in me, having a nice little vacation, looking at the sights and taking its time. And mutating. 
It‚Äôs as close to proven as it really can be that the Alpha and Delta variants were born in that exact way; an immunocompromised person who spent weeks to months dealing with the virus. A virus never stops evolving, but it needs TIME to do that. If you‚Äôve gotten vaccinated, you‚Äôre denying that virus much needed time to learn and mutate. Just like how you‚Äôre not sick for an extended time in the hospital. Maybe you get a breakthrough infection, but you‚Äôre not giving the virus the chance to learn what it needs to know from you to become bigger and badder.
I can hear the cries of ‚Äúwell then you stay home!‚Äù But you see, that‚Äôs just ignorance and selfishness. I take Humira. And Humira is the highest selling drug in the world. The people yearling that don‚Äôt care to know that I‚Äôm not a cancer patient. I haven‚Äôt had an organ transplant. I‚Äôm a 38 woman who owns a business and you‚Äôd never know by looking at me that my immune system is almost nonexistent. 
But I‚Äôm the patient you see much more frequently than others. Just normally. Without a pandemic going on.
Fact: the vaccine makes it less likely you will catch COVID. It also DOES reduce the spread and ANY reduction is STILL REDUCTION. 
Those medical ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù who refused to get a vaccine SHOULD be fired. They are either ignorant of their own field or uncaring assholes when it comes to their most frequently seen patients, or both I guess. But don‚Äôt think for a moment that variants wouldn‚Äôt slow way the hell down if everyone would get the vaccines. It would. Because you‚Äôd stop infecting ME. And THAT would be where you‚Äôd REALLY knock COVID out. If I‚Äôm not sick for an extended time, wow. You‚Äôve just really taken away the prime way that this virus continues to mutate at such an astronomical pace.
And bonus, you‚Äôre way less likely to end up in your own ICU, bogging down your coworkers, and way WAY less likely to be taking that last chance to live ECMO from people like me. 
To have my own selfish asshole moment, I deserve that bed and that ECMO more. I got my vaccines. I felt like shit afterwards. I feel like shit after my flu vaccine every year. Same with my pneumonia vaccine. Maybe I didn‚Äôt get many or any antibodies BUT I TRIED. 
If you are too stupid to understand science and how basic shit like vaccines work, I don‚Äôt want you to be giving me health advice. If you don‚Äôt give a shit about the most vulnerable of your patients you shouldn‚Äôt be in fucking healthcare.
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre overworked but don‚Äôt even try to pin any of your suffering on the mandates. Sir or ma‚Äôam you take that shit to the place your crappy situation actually was born from: YOUR OWN FORMER COWORKERS. Not even feeling the need to bring up how they should lead by goddamn example when it comes to the vaccines. They get them, crackpots stop taking their refusal as the sign that bill gates is definitely trying to inject everyone with satans microchips and turn them into human fridge magnets or what the hell ever, everyone gets their shots, no overcrowded hospitals. 
All your misery comes from those people. And given what they want they‚Äôd only be aiding the virus in rapid mutation that outpaces what the current vaccines can protect against thus leading to more loss of life. 
Do you get how your situation sucks because of the people you know and not the mandates now?",2022-01-08,5,COMMENT

Yet, people are worried about the tiny chance of getting it from one of the vaccines? When their chance of getting either one of these is actually significantly higher with covid?
To your point, myocarditis has been a very small risk and primarily to young men taking the Pfizer vaccine. There is a higher risk of many other things with pretty much any medication on the market (there are even risks to taking Advil and Tylenol). 
And most of the very small percentage of people that do get myocarditis post mRNA vaccine recover...on their own...with no treatment. There is treatment available for those that need it. But it's not some sort of death sentence.
Bottom line: if someone is worried about myocarditis or blood clots, they actually NEED the vaccine. Not an exemption. Covid is a much higher risk to someone prone to things like this than the vaccine ever will be.",2022-01-22,5,COMMENT

1. Vaccine Decision Making: It might have an effect on the decision of young healthy men like me to get the vaccine. Varicoceles can lead to infertility. If a man who has yet to have kids but wants kids knows that this prospect could be jeopardized by getting the vaccine, he might decide against it.
2. Scientific Knowledge: The cause of varicoceles is not truly known. Knowing that mRNA vaccines cause them could shed some light on other potential causes of varicoceles. Additionally, my urologist could tailor his approach to my condition based on this knowledge.

Unfortunately I was nudged in the direction of getting vaccinated by my college. Religious or health reasons could have worked as an exemption but I was leaning towards getting vaccinated anyways. 
I did do a lot of research and thinking about whether or not to get vaccinated. I am very conscious about what I put in my body (don't drink, smoke, do drugs, only take medication when absolutely necessary). My main conclusions were that I would rather have something that was designed to help (?) my body than something that is designed (in a lab through gain-of-function research?) to cause my body harm. Yes, we don't know the long-term side effects of the vaccine. But we also don't know the long-term side effects of COVD-19. It's sad but it's kind of a lose lose situation.

So you should be good to go from a physical standpoint. As for a medical card, I dont know about for schools, but even the military allows medical exemptions for proof of immunity (antibody test).  I dont know but maybe check with your school if proof of immunity would suffice and dont sweat it.   If you end up getting it, I hope youre ok!   
\*\*\*\*Permanent Exemptions may be granted indefinitely based on one of the following\*\*:  
Determination by a medical provider that further vaccination will seriously endanger patient's health  
Medical, Reactive exemption: Previously severe reaction after specific vaccine (e.g., anaphylaxis)  
Medical, Immune exemption: Evidence of existing immunity (e.g., by serologic antibody test, documentation of previous infection or natural infection presumed)\*\*\*\*",2022-01-05,1,COMMENT

Military Has Allowed It for Past Vaccines,https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccine/comments/popau7/medical_exemption_from_vaccine_mandate_for/hd15z6s/,CovidVaccine,"It certainly helps your business when the government mandates a large group of people to use your product...
There is evidence that suggests natural immunity is actually better than vaccination due to an immune response to more parts of the virus than just the spike. The thing with testing for antibodies is that it's a whole process and it's much easier financially and logistically to just jab everybody, even if it is not necessary to do so. That doesn't mean that they should bar the people who don't want to do it from testing out. Perhaps making testing more accessible and realistic is something the government should spend some of our tax money on.",2022-01-23,3,COMMENT

I'm fully vaccinated and, no, I don't know what's in it - neither this vaccine, the ones I had as a child, nor in the Big Mac, or in hot dogs, or in other treatments‚Ä¶whether it's for cancer, AIDS, the one for polyarthritis, or vaccines for infants or children.  
I also don't know what's in Ibuprofen, Paracetamol , or other meds, it just cures my headaches & my pains.    
I don't know what's in the ink for tattoos, vaping, Botox and fillers, or every ingredient in my soap or shampoo or even deodorants. I don‚Äôt know the long term effect of mobile phone use or whether or not that restaurant I just ate at REALLY used clean foods and washed their hands.   
In short ...  
There's a lot of things I don't know and never will‚Ä¶   
I just know one thing: life is short, very short,  and I still want to do something other than just going to work every day or staying locked in my home. I still want to travel and hug people without fear and find a little feeling of life ""before"".  
As a child and as an adult I've been vaccinated for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, chicken pox, and quite a few others; my parents and I trusted the science and never had to suffer through or transmit any of said diseases.  
I'm vaccinated, not to please the government but:  
\* To not die from Covid-19.  
\* To NOT clutter a hospital bed if I get sick.  
\* To hug my loved ones   
\* To Not have to do PCR or antigenic tests to go out dancing, go to a restaurant, go on holidays and many more things to come ...  
\* To live my life.  
\* To have kids go back to school and play sports.   
\* For Covid-19 to be an old memory.  
\* To protect us.

>the vaccine has been repeatedly proved to harm a person's body and immune system, instead of fortifying it. It is not producing antibodies right. Any positive effects also wear of within months, so boosters will be essential. However, the vaccine is only targeting the spike of the virus. This allows the virus room to mutate and get around people's immune defenses. Rather, if your body fights off the virus, it is killed, and you gain resilience and immunity. 
This could indeed cause a problem long term, as Geert Vanden Bossche theorizes; in the case of mass vaccinations leading to vaccine resistant variants, we could be in a bad position due to an inability to sterilize the virus upon infection. Moreso, I'm not sure about the spike protein ""harming a person's immune system"", though, in a scenario where the vaccine becomes ineffective due to a more resilient mutation - the existing memory from the S protein may impede our ability to create a new defensive immune response to the new variation of virus. The same could occur to an attenuated vaccine, if one is made in the future, rendering it incapable of producing immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. (Note: I don't know the likelihood of attenuated vaccines being produced in the near future).
As for harming your body: it's true that a circumstance of this variation of mrna vaccines, unfortunately seems to be that the lipid nanoparticles used to transport the messenger rna to your cells (which then create the spike protein, for your immune system to learn from), don't stay where they should. The issue being that in the event that spike protein is produced by other cells in your body i.e. brain, spinal chord, ovaries etc, your immune system will begin to target and eliminate otherwise healthy and necessary cells in your body. 
For this reason, alot of people are very hopeful about novavax, which uses moth cells to multiply a version of baculovirus which is modified to include the spike protein. Though, it doesn't have the same level of data as the other vaccines and it uses the very same spike protein, this method of delivery could be safer, especially for younger age groups. 
But very well written. I hope you continue to grow, learn and use your talents to find interests, happiness and success for yourself! 
- By the way, lockdowns are very tough mentally. Try to exercise, even if it's just a few sit ups, pushups and pull ups or some running or football.. and get as much sun as possible. I know you won't feel like doing much because you can't see your friends and life seems gloomy, but trust me, it's hardest to start and you'll always feel better after doing it a bit!

781,phfa2z,How likely is antibody dependent enhancement to occur with the covid vaccine?,https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccine/comments/phfa2z/how_likely_is_antibody_dependent_enhancement_to/hbil4kz/,CovidVaccine,">Efficacy can mean different things. If you want total immunity the efficacy will be lower because you can still get one of the strains. If you get vaccinated and still get some symptoms they don‚Äôt really know which strain it is. When it comes to data there are variables that affect the interpretation of the data. Such as determining efficacy when there‚Äôs multiple stains out. With Covid it‚Äôs important to look at hospitalization, ICU utilization and severe cases to determine efficacy. If you want a personal story I was vaccinated and my husband wasn‚Äôt and he just tested pos after being sick (fevers, congestion cough and serious fatigue.) and I‚Äôve never felt better. I‚Äôve been working in the hospital with Covid patients and haven‚Äôt gotten it. We are in a discovery phase right now and data is being collected daily on the vaccinated and if they are getting sick. They may be testing positive but the evidence is overwhelming that they aren‚Äôt getting serious Covid. The problem with Covid is that you don‚Äôt know if you will be the one to end up on a vent or throw a clot, or be completely asymptomatic. I had moderate Covid before I could get the vaccine and lost 3 weeks of my life. I wasn‚Äôt willing to risk getting that sick again or being out of work to quarantine or to have Covid disrupt my life any more than it already has.

Isn't it too soon to know if the vaccines cause ADE? My (albeit limited) understanding is that ADE usually becomes apparent upon second or subsequent exposure to the virus, usually after the virus has mutated several times. So wouldn't it take a year or two to know if the vaccines are causing ADE?
On the other hand, am I correct that the risk of ADE is not limited to the vaccines, and that ADE can also occur after natural infection with COVID?",2022-01-22,1,COMMENT

They showed extreme cases of ""log covid"", then said ""up to 50% of young people develop a long covid"" - talk about misinformation !
Mostly for professional reasons, I did get vaccinated.  Ended up being Moderna.  I was sick for two weeks after the first shot: drained, joint pain, and some (more moderate) chest pain - which I didn't worry about because it was going away if I got up and walk...
Told all this to the nurse when I went for my second shot; I was in a university center, so they called-in a doctor who just said ""nah, this looks like nothing that the vaccine would cause"".  So they just encouraged me to go ahead and take my second shot, which I did.
I'm in my high forties, but sporty (swimming, hiking, weightlifting).  After my second shot I thought ok, I shall not let go of myself.  So in spite of symptoms appearing again, 6 days after my shot I went swimming in open waters... and after a few minutes had a violent paralyzing, chest pain. I barely managed to gasp for air, stay idle at the surface, relax ... and reach back for help.  It was the first time in my life I thought I might die !
Luckily, this wasn't a full blown heart attack, but apparently I'm a victim of the myocarditis/pericarditis that the vaccines can cause.  Three weeks after my 2nd shot I'm still under treatment for it, taking high-dose NSAIDs to moderate the pain (which was waking me up at night, chest pain irradiating into my left arm).  Things seem under control now, but my treatment is ongoing, and I'm not ready yet to resume exercising.
What makes me furious is that Moderna had issued (in Switzerland, my country), 4 days before my second jab, a warning letter asking that all vaccinated persons be informed that they must immediately consult a doctor in case of any chest pain.  And in other countries (Belgium, Singapore), authorities go further by advising the public that any intense physical activity must be avoided in the days that follow your jabs.
I informed my vaccination center, and got a kind of apologetic call from their medical director, but he still justified that each vaccinating nurse(is all personnel even that qualified?) is to decide which side effects are to be communicated to each individual. How does this constitute an ""informed consent"" !?!?
So yes, I'm a new account, but a real person, and a real victim of the vaccine - which for me was clearly much worse than COVID itself (I've been caring for parents who were confirmed cases and wanted to stay in their home during their sickness, pretty sure I caught it then, although I had mild or no symptoms at all).
Am I an exception, just bad luck?  I don't know, it doesn't seem like anyone cared to report me as someone who is suffering severe side effects.  Authorities don't seem to care !",2022-01-22,1,COMMENT

In short and simple terms: vaccines activate your antibodies, antibodies naturally trigger inflammation, inflammation triggers other underlying conditions you already have and creates a hormonal imbalance (irregular periods).
So for example, when you have a flu (the normal kind everyone occasionally gets), your body activates the antibodies to fight the flu virus. Your body's antibodies being activated naturally results in side-effects such as fever, body aches, inflammation, and a minor hormonal imbalance. Inflammation triggers underlying illnesses (eczema etc). The harder your antibodies fight, the harsher the side-effects. 
A normal flu virus isnt that strong so the antibodies don't have to fight that hard, so the side-effects you get are minor or barely noticeable. The COVID virus is extremely strong and your antibodies arent able to fight them back naturally (hence dead people or alive people with permanent lung damage) so they send in a ""fake virus"" (vaccine) to train the antibodies. You get the same natural side-effects you would get from a regular flu: fever, body aches, inflammation (+side-effects), and hormonal imbalance. Antibodies are being trained to fight harder, therefore your side-effects also are harsher. The side-effects are NOT permanent and if you've ever had a flu in your life, you've already experienced these side-effects to a lesser degree. 
So no, you dont get infertile just because you have hormonal imbalance or irregular periods. 80% of women already suffer from hormonal imbalance but they're still having babies. BUT its true that it takes a much longer time for hormones to re-balance, and you have to take extra care of yourself (eat healthy, exercise) to help re-balance. Which is super annoying and frustrating, but hardly comparable to infertility.",2021-12-31,7,COMMENT

>The¬†false report¬†said that getting the COVID-19 vaccine would cause a woman‚Äôs body to fight this different spike protein and affect her fertility. The two spike proteins are completely different, and getting the COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the fertility of women who are seeking to become pregnant, including through in vitro fertilization methods. During the Pfizer vaccine tests, 23 women volunteers involved in the study became pregnant, and the only one in the trial who suffered a pregnancy loss had not received the actual vaccine, but a placebo.

To even completely know if there‚Äôs an effect on fertility we‚Äôll have to wait for the generation to be born post vaccine rollout to grow to reproductive age, so~18years, because often it is the second generation that are effected.
That being said, do you have a source for the animal studies, because as far as I was aware Pfizer didn‚Äôt even conduct reproductive studies before the rollout, so unless they have done it since, it‚Äôs news to me that there even were any studies.
Anyone who regurgitates the line that no corners were cut in the testing of this vaccine obviously haven't done their own research. 
In answer to OP, it‚Äôs seriously your choice to make, and you have to be comfortable with the choice you make. No one can make it for you, and I‚Äôm sure your family are coming from a place of love and caring for you, but in terms at knowing whether it‚Äôll effect your fertility, no one knows yet. Personally I would say if you have other co-morbidities such as being overweight, diabetic, high blood pressure or low vitamin D levels, I would consider taking it, otherwise the risks are extremely small that you will die from covid.
And as for the argument that the vaccinated make of ‚Äòdo it to protect everyone around you‚Äô,  well it‚Äôs been proven that vaccinated can catch and spread the virus just as well as unvaccinated people, and so are just as much ‚Äòvariant factories‚Äô as anyone else.",2022-01-22,2,COMMENT

OP, you should not even have to ask this- in the U.K. early on in the rollout it was found that anyone with a history of any serious allergic reactions (that required an epipen intervention) were at risk of having a serious reaction to the jab, and so were warned not to take it.
Now throw in the fact that you‚Äôre directly allergic to an ingredient that‚Äôs actually in the vaccine, and that is a no brainer! 
I can‚Äôt speak for the other vaccines, but would imagine the moderna one may also contain PEG, but not sure. You may be ok with the AstraZeneca, but I would recommend you do your own research into the ingredients of each vaccine to make sure there is definitely no PEG in them. Don‚Äôt rely on thinking that your doctor would necessarily know this.

No I was not on any medication by the time I got the vaccine, nor did I ever have any problems with my hair. After my experience I can only warn you about the Pfizer vaccine.

If what happened to me over the past couple of weeks were to happen to a teenager that might cause severe mental health problems. So in the interest of your daughter think twice before you vaccinate her with Pfizer.

There is a natural medicine called [Bee Propolis](https://www.beeculture.com/propolis/) it has been used for thousands of years to treat a host of different illnesses, however recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415165/) has said that it is very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2. 
My husband, his mother and I have used it as a preventative this whole time and none of us has become ill. Even better, however is that, my 64 year old mother and 74 year old stepfather both tested positive for Covid in January of this year and were suffering from coughing, sinus pressure, fatigue (and my mom had this bloody nose thing happening too - bleeding almost all day down the back of her throat). I had told them to use the Bee Propolis and she ordered some. It came in on day 4 of her illness and day 5 of his and they both used it and within 6 hours were feeling better and within 24 hours were completely symptom free.
I have suggested the use of it to a number of other people who have come down with Covid and of the people who have used it, every single one of them has recovered in 24 hours. (Including 2 strangers from the internet in forums on Telegram. One girl told me her sense of taste and smell returned to her the very next morning after using the BP.)
It comes in different forms; nose spray, throat spray, tinctures and pills. Every one who I have told about it has either used the nose spray or throat spray and it worked well. The highest concentration of the extract you can get is 65%, so I would recommend you get that if you decide to try it (and I really hope that you do). Best thing that could happen is that it works for you, worst thing is that it has no effect and you are no better off than you are now.(Unless you happen to be allergic to bee products such as honey.)
Now, it works for those who are ill with Covid, but it is my belief that it might also help people who are suffering from side effects of the injections. In the research papers it describes the properties of Bee Propolis as being able to block the ACE2 receptors from the spike protein - and if the spike protein is the thing that your body is having trouble with (because of the injection) - then it stands to reason that BP could be beneficial to people who are having adverse events of the injections. Either way, it‚Äôs 100% natural so BP won‚Äôt hurt.

If you're kind and patient, listen to their concerns, explain what you know and share resources with them then that's your best shot. If you shut them down immediately they won't want to talk with you about it again. If you prove to them that you'll listen and discuss without judgement they might. 
In the same way we are taught that telling someone that they must stop smoking because they'll get lung cancer is unlikely to result in them giving up smoking. But if we tell them that smoking has been linked to poor health and that we are here to discuss quitting and give them support when they're ready they are much more likely to.

Whilst no test is perfect they're pretty good. You're right vaccinated people do still get covid and can still die but the chances of both of these are greatly reduced.
Think about food poisoning whilst you can still get it from cooked meat, cooking your chicken breast say will significantly reduce that risk. In every situation we have to make our own decision based on the risks involved. 
Having seen covid kill in the ICU and the devastation it's brought upon families. It was my choice to gey vaccinated and test regularly to protect myself and people I come into contact with.

The best way to think about it is in terms of packages. 
The boxes are the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and what‚Äôs inside the box is the mRNA that codes for the spike protein. 
Research has come out saying that the spike protein is enough to cause damage to our systems. It would be okay if the boxes (LNP) just stayed in the injection site, but research is also showing it travels throughout our bodies, which could be the reason why we hear about really strange side effects (blood clots, paralysis, numbness, autoimmune disorders, etc.) 
Do I think de-population is the ‚Äúagenda?‚Äù My heart says no, but it really makes me second guess when the government starts denying early treatments and countries are reported deaths post vaccine by the thousands and, in some, tens of thousands.

What I do trust is data and evidence. I have no valid reasons for you not to get it except if you are allergic to polyethylene glycol which is miralax  but is a preservative and polysorbate  also a preservative. Or if you just don‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôm against mandates or any breach of a persons free will. 
Here are the facts. Pfizer and Modena work by mrna. Mrna is a messenger that hangs out in the cytoplasm, and long story short, instructs the ribosome to make what ever protein is encoded in it. We do this constantly. What the vaccine does is inserts mrna coded with the instructions to make only spike proteins. So, when you are infected with Covid naturally the virus binds to and enters epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and instructs the cell to make more virus. Virus‚Äô have to hijack a living cell to replicate. The vaccine is just the mrna telling the cell to make spike proteins. The mrna last for maybe 24hrs before the cells enzymes break it down and waste it. The cells make the spike proteins. I read they are present for up to 2 weeks before the immune system removes them too. So you are left with antibodies to just the spike protein. There‚Äôs nothing bad about this. The mrna can‚Äôt enter your dna and it breaks down very fast. Which is why it has to stay cold and it expires vary fast after opening. I worked many hrs in the vaccine clinics. The J&j vaccine an AZ are attenuated virus. That is basically a virus that can‚Äôt infect you, similar to the ones we‚Äôve all had in the past. The cell is an amazing thing and so is the immune system. 
The problem with the vaccine right now is it‚Äôs efficacy. It‚Äôs not showing as great of efficacy as it was in the beginning. This is due to variants and the variables between peoples immune systems.  if your immune system sucks then you won‚Äôt get good immunity from any vaccine. We‚Äôve lived a year stressed out and locked down so everyone has a weaker then normal immune system. I suspect that has something to do with the efficacy as well. The other aspect is that not all viruses are created equal. Things like chicken pox are very stable they don‚Äôt mutate and immunity holds for a lifetime. Things like the common cold and the flu and corona virus‚Äô mutate rapidly and frequently and we just don‚Äôt hold immunity to those. So this is shaping up to be like the flu in that there will be multiple variants and different variants seasonally and there may be different vaccines every year like the flu. We aren‚Äôt there yet and only have one. This one provides some protection but it‚Äôs not as good as natural immunity according to a new study. Having said that you don‚Äôt know if you will have a mild case or a serious case. so, in my opinion if you‚Äôve never had Covid And don‚Äôt know what your body will do with it, I would get the vaccine. 
So To sum things up. 175 million people have gotten both doses with very few rare complications. This is the determining factor that it‚Äôs safe. Not only that, it‚Äôs been 10 months or so and if there were going to be long term immune system malfunction it would show up in that time. When an autoimmune disorder is triggered by an illness it‚Äôs usually within weeks. Things like type 1 diabetes and hashimotos can be triggered by viruses, any vaccine any stress on the body but there‚Äôs no indication that this vaccine will cause any long term problems over and above the normal risks.  
It is a clear liquid so it doesn‚Äôt have nanotechnology in it. It would have to be undetectable to the human eye. The nano tech that‚Äôs out there is very small but you can still see it. There are things and theoretical technology out there that have scary implications, but at this time we don‚Äôt have the technology to implement that kind of thing into vaccines on a global scale. 
I have interacted with hundreds of people who have gotten it with zero issues. 
It‚Äôs a risk benefit analysis for each person. I prob won‚Äôt make my kids get it because we all already had Covid and natural immunity is showing to be better. And they handled it fine. I had Covid and got pneumonia so for me it made sense to get the vaccine to prevent getting as sick as I did the first time. Right now I‚Äôm glad I got it because my husband, I suspect, has thr delta variant rn, a mild case and I‚Äôm not sick at all. I‚Äôve seen people who were vaccinated in the hospital for other things with positive Covid test and no serious symptoms so it does work at least some. 
If you want a more scientific explanation here is a link [ninja nerd ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=35Idb_lCU4o)
Another thing to thing about is correlation does not equal causation. All these people who say I‚Äôve had this happen after the vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccine caused it. That‚Äôs like me getting into a car accident after leaving the vaccine clinic and saying thr vaccine caused my accident. The biggest reason why this whole thing is so messed up is because a large percentage of the population is fat and sick. They may not think they are fat and sick but everyone Is fat and sick if you were to look at their blood work. Most complicated Covid and deaths are in fat sick people. I was on the icu when we had the largest Spike and saw 6 ppl die in a week all overweight and had comorbidities. The best thing you can do is get healthy",2022-01-22,4,COMMENT

So, people who are very likely to get the vaccine are simply put
1. People who do as the government says
2. People who accept a vaccine without questioning it or questioning what's in it or where it came from
3. People who believe what most mainstream media tell them
4. People who are too scared of something that they will do anything to avoid it
5. People who are easy to bribe
While people who don't get the vaccine are
6. People who are critically questioning the government's and big pharma's motives
7. Anti-vaxxers
8. People who don't trust their leaders and politicians anymore
So... With that in mind if I was the leader of a country or some higher up of a big pharma company... Wouldn't it be way more attractive to me to let persons 1-5 live, rather than 6-8? Because 6-8 won't take my vaccines, so I'm not making big money AND they will be a pain in my government's butt because they won't be my lap dogs.
FWIW, I'm really torn on this whole matter also, but this whole population control argument, I find not convincing, because I can't see how the puppet masters would benefit from that. (While, on the other hand, the population control theory of ""kill the old and let all the young ones have more children for better pensions"" made more sense to me.)

Ik of plenty of people in my own town which is really small that have passed or been in the ICU.,2022-01-08,0,COMMENT

A friend of mine had severe side effects after the vaccine and she tried to spread awareness about it because she believes that people should be able to make informed decisions (I totally agree with her on this) and she started posting about her experience on social media, not spreading misinformation or anything but just sharing her experiences however she was banned from over 15 facebook groups about vaccines and her instagram account is heavily shadow-banned.

The skin needs to be very dry so that the cause of sticking can rule out friction in favor of magnetism. 
You can get a lot of stuff to stick to your skin just due to friction, it's a fairly old party trick.

Thanks for the reply ..
I never had allergic reactions before but did have sensitive skin. 
Over the past week or so I‚Äôve been researching and looking into what triggers my symptoms .. 
some food seems to trigger my symptoms ,
Alcohol.. & dust, pollen, dogs etc .
I think certain food ( I discovered chocolate .. after my throat started to feel like it tighten) then followed by me being aggressively sick. 
I think after having my 2nd dose of vaccine I‚Äôm producing too much histamine in my body.
MCAS (mass cell activation Syndrome) - I think I‚Äôve developed this after the covid vaccine. 
I‚Äôve read that MCAS is not curable and you can only manage the symptoms.. which is not ideal. 
I hope I‚Äôm wrong and hope that I will just wake up and be how I was before.
My doctor prescribed me 180mg of fexofenadine to take twice daily. I still get my symptoms throughout the day ( itching, burning ear senesations, upset stomach, numb legs occasionally) but I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still learning on what food trigger / how to eliminate allergens around me to my best ability.",2021-12-25,1,COMMENT

1 tip to not get so anxious until you're waiting: bring water with you. It helps since when you're anxious, you produce less saliva and your mouth becomes dry. It gives you the false sensation you can't swallow, which contributes for your anxiety by increasing your self-focus.

1. Yes some vaccines will create a thrombic event (ex blood clots) but that does not mean that‚Äôs why you are having headaches. You should 100% see a doctor who will tell you if you had a blood clot in your brain you would NOT be walking around months later.
2. DDimers are amazing at predicting if you DONT have a clot if the test comes back negative. If it comes back positive there are many things that can raise DDimer levels. Years ago I had a high DDimer for a full year and got CT scans and other blood work which NEVER showed a clot. They can be positive because of inflammation, illness , and cancer. I JUST took another DDimer a few months after my Pfizer and it was negative even though I am also having weird headaches and other not awesome things after the vaccine.
Please don‚Äôt believe in people‚Äôs black and white answers. I‚Äôm pro-vax but totally think it‚Äôs hurting people too and unless we move away from being 100% vax or 100% antivax we won‚Äôt get answers about what‚Äôs going on with our bodies because we will be see as hypochondriacs.

You can find PEG in other medications or products, including cosmetics (toothpaste, shampoo, etc), and PEGs are also used in the preparation of certain foods (eg. ice creams). However, the fact you don't react to a product containing a PEG, does not exclude 100% that you will react to an intravascular administration of a PEG, although it seems less likely.

I don't think the vaccine is poison, but I definitely wouldn't take one during pregnancy/feeding either because there just isn't the data to support that being done safely. I think it is overall beneficial because the virus is unfortunately very real and deadly. Reactions like this are rare. I can't tell you how many vaccinated people I know that had just the basic, flu-like reaction or none at all. But, it was developed in ""warp speed"" and it would be weird if they got it 100% right the first time.

My 64 year old mother and my 74 year old stepfather both had Covid twice. And they are completely fine. 
I do have 1 friend named Michael that took the Moderna injection and he has died. 50 years old, white male, took the first dose on March 22, 2021 and the second on April 19, 2021. He passed away on June 18th. He was in okayish health, little overweight but otherwise healthy. 2 days after he took the 1st injection he was complaining of extremely high blood pressure (165/100). He passed away from complications in heart due to the Moderna injection.

But I don‚Äôt disagree at 6 hours and at 24 hours, the concentrations at the injection site do diminish, and elsewhere those numbers side in the larger intestine, Testicals and Ovaries and some other areas. 
I appreciate genuine criticism, as I openly admit I am not in the medical community, and I am concerned by the way both the media, politicians and the public are acting by dismissing and censoring what is genuine concern.  
So I would rather like to try a d make sense of what I don‚Äôt see in the Pfizer report, and other documents that are like the UK laws on vaccine and clinical studies, where the information is meant to be for public observation.  
But when I did a freedom of Information request on a few areas of interest regarding the vaccines, I was given this link as a generic response. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/freedom-of-information-responses-from-the-mhra-week-commencing-12-april-2021/freedom-of-information-request-about-study-data-for-the-pfizerbiontech-vaccine-foi-21-340
Now I have that in the form of the Japanese government report, but the public accountability data, on patients with adverse reactions, is also withheld and other relevant information, which would be accessible, bit is restricted.  So we must trust people like Matt Handcock, to state that the vaccine is perfectly safe and that the 60 who passed away due to vaccine complications is an accurate number.

Also take Magnesium Citrate because that will assist with your bodies uptake of the Vitamin D. Take Zinc also. You can look up Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, she has some advice for people that have taken the injection on what to take to naturally detox your body. In my humble opinion, I think the sooner you start, the better off you will be. 
Another thing to take a look at is Bee Propolis. When this whole thing began, I remembered how my mom used to make me take Bee Propolis when I was a kid and had a sore throat or a cough - that stuff absolutely cured it right up. I did some research on it and found that it is effective against Coronaviruses and since this began there have been a couple more scientific papers come out that say it may be very effective against this Covid virus. 
Now, all that to say this - that IF it ends up being true that this mRNA injection could cause immune resistance to things like the common cold - THEN arming yourself with Bee Propolis could very well help in making sure your body does not end up in an overreaction because you got the injections.

I got the J&J. A few hours later I had some issues with my gait because I was really lightheaded so I went to bed early hoping to ""sleep it off"". The next day was a lot different, I felt fine in the morning and logged onto to work, however my condition started to rapidly deteriorate over the day. I ended up in the emergency room 24 hrs post shot because I couldn't breathe. I had a low grade fever, migraines, shortness of breath, chest pain, shooting pains through all my limbs, my right hand went numb, extreme exhaustion - I couldn't make it across my living room without gasping for air, extreme back pain, like the worst I'd ever felt, my heart was nearing 130 resting as well. I ended up at the hospital for xrays and blood work for possible clots (that would have been unrelated at the time) and everything came back normal except for lung inflammation. I was given an inhaler spacer and a steroid to resolve it. There was some speculation that I may have have asymptomatic Covid at some point in the last year because apparently the reaction to the vaccine can be more severe/immediate if you've already had Covid before and have antibodies already.
I felt much better using the spacer to breathe the majority of other symptoms subsided in a day or so. However, I was still having random shocking pains in my head and violent shocking pains in my thighs and calves that persisted for at least two weeks as well as the shortness of breath. I have asthma and it was well managed, however I needed to use the spacer with 6 puffs 4 times a day to breathe correctly, that's in conjunction with Advair and Singulair, something I've never had to do in my life. I returned to my primary care physician who advised me to report the entire situation to VAERS which I did a few days later. Blood work for clots was ordered again due to the ongoing leg pain and it came back clear. The stabbing pain in my calves and thighs was still persisting so I had an ultrasound which was also clear. The same day I was at my primary I also got an X-ray... this is where things get weird. I was x-rayed in the hospital the day after the vaccine and it was clear, I now have an apparent opacity in the right lower lobe of my lung that has developed between 24hrs after getting the vaccine and two weeks later. I was given a z-pak in case it was pneumonia, however while it seemed to help for a few days, I'm back to having breathing difficulty, it's 3 weeks later now. I also still have the shooting pains in my legs, however they're very sporadic vs how they were regularly happening pretty constantly prior. It doesn't appear anyone has any clear idea of what's happening to me as well which is also causing me major anxiety.",2022-01-03,1,COMMENT

I‚Äôm not sure about the vaccine efficacy against strains, look at this:
Calgary hospital has 22 cases linked to Delta COVID-19 variant, including 10 fully vaccinated
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/canada/alberta/article-covid-19-outbreak-at-calgary-hospital-linked-to-delta-variant-grows-to/
What Dr.Geert and the mRNA vaccines inventor predicted is currently happening:
Antibody-dependent enhancement. As predicted, the vaccinated are at greater risk because they are immune to the specific spike protein and not the whole virus. It's allowing new strains with enough variance to be a trojan horse and take hold worse than they otherwise would have. Rolling out a vaccine in the middle of a pandemic is just putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to evade the spike protein protection.

1644,nt05cl,JJ vaccine,https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccine/comments/nt05cl/jj_vaccine/h0pun0o/,CovidVaccine,">the way mRNA attaches to cells
First off, the JJ vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, it is the more traditional virus based type (similar to the flu vaccine or chicken pox vaccine).
>spread nano particles eventually to all cells
That's not even remotely how that works. It tells a certain group of cells to produce the spike protein for a time being. Your body then recognizes and destroys them thus learning how to defeat the active part of the virus. 
>When this was studied for 8 whole weeks
This vaccine was studied for about 11 months, and was peer reviewed more than any other vaccine in history with the exception of Pfizer's vaccine as they basically had unlimited funding to work on it. 
>autoimmune conditions happen
Autoimmune issues are something you already have, basically an allergy. If you have a tree nut allergy then they are dangerous for you, if you don't they are not. Same goes for the vaccine. It doesn't cause the autoimmune issue, but if you already have it at can aggravate it. And it wont show up years later either just like a tree nut allergy wont show up years later as the allergen is long gone by that point. 
>NO ONE knows what's the long term effects
While partially true, you are missing the fact that this type of vaccine has been around for over 150 years and we know a whole lot about them. The only parts we really don't know at this point are how long this specific vaccine will give you immunity for.
The part of the vaccine that was causing the blood clots was an additive that was removed in more recent batches as it had an insanely rare side effect. You really need to actually read up on what you are talking about as you are spreading some serious misinformation.",2021-12-25,4,COMMENT

They are just deaths REPORTED by people who had recently received from vaccine and died(and with those numbers that's about .0017%). Vaers accepts all reports of deaths. But it has to be looked into and investigated if they are actually related at all to the vaccine and I wasn't able to see anything that indicated that it was proven. It looks like the J&J may be the only vaccine that could possibly be linked to a couple deaths due to blood clot issues. Which is incredibly rare (1 in a million chance) and they are working the kinks out now so that doesn't happen again.
People are going to coincidentally die after getting the vaccine. It's just going to happen when millions of people get vaccinated. Specially old people. Those deaths may be reported to Vaers, but it doesn't mean the vaccine caused them to die.",2022-01-22,4,COMMENT

But the moderna shot was really hard on 3 of us, relative to our muscles or fatigue in comparison to Pfizer . I've been having nerve issues, specifically my right sciatica up to my right buttock...my muscles were tight  from the second shot. But my right buttock was like a rock,, towards the top. It locked up like that. It was like I have a permanent cramp which hurts all the time. If I walk after about 20 steps I want to collapse from the pain. I worked that knot out, 5 days later it stopped. I still have it come and go when I walk. So I stop and lean on something to 'stretch'the pain out of my leg, or I use crutches, which I now have all the time. I've been having for lack of any other way to explain it, weird hard aches from my nerves.. I received the 2nd Moderna shot on 5/2, this started on 5/6.

Look everyone, I believe in the vaccine, but I'm writing this anyway, because I spent 7 hours in the ER, getting a cat scan and xrays. Now they say I need an MRI to look at my nerves.That needs scheduling. So I will follow up here later. Then the ER ust discharged me. They gave me nerve blockers, without knowing what is wrong. Like a bad disk, or hip. The doc explained to me that he checked me for life and death situation, made sure I was ok, gave me stuff for the nerve pain. I would have to continue with Neuorontin and talk to my Primary care doc. And it's time to leave. So I left.  I went to urgent care for a steroid shot today, 3 days later. It did nothing to help me so far. So even thou this all may be a coincidence. I was literally fine with no pain In my body before the 1st shot. I got the vaccine, my muscles tightened, and I've been in pain ever since that. If you leave this post up, you may find that other people may be having this issue. I need to be clear to the mods and kens and Karens.I do not write this to discourage people from getting the shot. Because I am pro shot. I have parents, and grandparents and the risk of killing them outweighs my fears of the shot. 
But now I cant put pressure on my right leg without Neurontin or I get extreme pain. Honestly I hope its hip replacement or something, but the ER did a CAT, plus xrays, and he says my hip is fine. I have never hurt my hip. So I fell asleep writing this. I just woke up at 4am just now in extreme pain in my nerve in my right leg aching, for no reason. So I am writing this. In 1 week I have 0 change. Every day is extreme pain, and the doctors dont have any idea what is wrong. Anyone have any comments? And Mods, I would appreciate it if you not delete this post. I have read of people having this problem, so we should find out if anyone else has had NERVE issues. I dont know why I am sick. And I hope it is logical when they find out. But for now, they are scratching their heads and throwing medicine at me to block my pain, which is working. I just dont know if I want to block my pain as much as stop this pain. My entire lower body is aching from my nerves atm. Anybody else have nerve symptoms? I really need guidance. I have never had pain like this in my hip or leg in my life until now.
 Thanks in advance for your answers and comments.

Anyone with anything from autoimmune diseases, history of cancer, diabetes, and so on were excluded from the trial. Unfortunately there are 10,000 of reactions ranging from moderate to severe that have been public all logged by the CDC. 
It needs to be noted that many autoimmune groups noted a flare in their symptoms post vaccine. The issue with this is many auto immune diseases can take years to diagnose. So if someone who is not being managed by medicine, because they don‚Äôt know what is going on with them yet, receives a vaccine and experiences ‚Äúa flair‚Äù without knowing they are having one, they don‚Äôt have the meds to mange said symptoms and body responses which can be dangerous.
Secondly the CDC IS investigating why there have been so many myocarditis cases post covid vaccine and it‚Äôs mainly happening in males below 30.

1814,nihgst,indian doctor succumb to covid despite full vaccine,https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccine/comments/nihgst/indian_doctor_succumb_to_covid_despite_full/gz2cnkc/,CovidVaccine,"This is not correct.  With the mNRA vaccines, there are theoretically millions of variations that could impact the virus as a whole without altering the protein spike the vaccine mimics to provoke immunity in a vaccinated individual.  And even minor variations in that actual spike might not be sufficient to allow the virus to evade detection by an immune system educated to recognize the generic spike.  Several common variations have already proven susceptible to the vaccine induced immunity, and to date, none have been found that aren't.  Part of the genius of this particular mode of vaccinating is it's robustness in the face of a rapidly mutating virus.  The rest of what makes it particularly effective is that a mutation that effects this specific protein spike (the one that lets it enter and infect your cells) is just as likely to make it unable to interact with and infect your cells, as it is to help it evade your immune system.

Here's an interesting article regarding T-cells: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00367-7). 
I wasn't referring to T-cell immunity as protective immunity. The presence of killer T-cells in the lungs from prior infection prevent transmission from where there is large viral shedding, thus contributing to herd immunity if the host cannot transmit the virus if/when subsequently re-infected. 
Not a single hospital in the UK has collapsed due to Covid. I'm referring to the UK when I'm talking about the additional pressures being placed upon the NHS due to vaccine side effects. 
These vaccines are still experimental. The FDA in the US can't approve them until longer term assessment has been done. There are reasons for such due diligence. Long term side effects from vaccines do exist. There are an increasing number of cases emerging to suggest that adverse reactions are more severe in people who are vaccinated following prior infection with covid, and the reactions they have experienced have been worse than those they experienced during infection with Covid.
With reference to your comment about doctors in developed countries dying too - in the UK at least all doctors have now been vaccinated, as have all other health workers. All vulnerable people are close to having received both injections. Are you saying that India has already vaccinated all its doctors when you mentioned that India has already tried this approach? In which case that would mean that the vaccines don't work against the Indian strain. It wasn't clear what you meant so I may have picked this up wrong. Surely it would be kindest for the UK/US and other countries to provide our remaining vaccines to healthcare workers and the vulnerable in those countries facing the greatest current crises before giving them to the non-vulnerable in countries where currently 0 or close to zero daily deaths are being recorded (the UK for example). India, Nepal, Bangladesh etc are facing the most serious turmoil due to Covid at the moment and it seems unimaginably cruel and selfish of other countries who are not in crisis to squander their vaccines on the non-vulnerable ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-57154233](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-57154233)).
As you mention, SARS-CoV-2 is very effective at spreading. As such many more people have been infected than can be accounted for by the PCR tests. The death rate is now estimated at 0.15% which is on par with a serious flu season. Many people have also developed some degree of natural immunity, and this will aid in making future iterations of the disease less impactful and more akin to an average flu season.",2022-01-05,3,COMMENT

I'm not sure about the difference in viral load between vaccinated people who have been exposed to coronavirus and of asymptomatic people. Asymptomatic people have very low, almost undetectable viral loads. The PCR tests work by effectively magnifying the viral load by many orders to detect if any virus exists in a person's nostrils. It remains uncertain at which level of viral load a person can transmit the virus to others, e.g. via transmission when talking. However, if vaccines work to reduce transmission via reducing (but not eliminating) viral load, then it seems to me that it would follow that asymptomatic transmission was never possible in the first place. There is no conclusive proof that asymptomatic transmission is possible. In fact, a study of 10 million people tested in Wuhan found no evidence of asymptomatic transmission (the findings were published in a BMJ article).",2022-01-05,1,COMMENT

I agree, high vaccination rates have given great reprieve from cases of severe illness, as is the case in Israel and the UK. Natural immunity has also played some role in cases being reduced. Given that the virus is now endemic it will continue to find pathways to infecting people and new strains will develop. I believe that caution needs to be taken with over-vaccinating a population (i.e. vaccinating children and the non-vulnerable) as that can lead to the new strains finding pathways that evade the immunity that the vaccines provide, such that continued transmission and hence survival of the virus is possible. We need the vaccines to continue to be a useful means of preventing severe disease in the most vulnerable around the world. I agree with vaccinating the vulnerable, and health care workers, and I would agree with full population vaccination if SARS-CoV-2 was a static disease, like polio or measles or chickenpox. In the case of these other diseases the same vaccine that was used 20 years ago can be used today. That is not the case for an evolving virus that is more similar in form to a cold virus (although significantly more severe in its current iteration).
Covid can have long-term effects, but so too can the vaccines, and these effects need to be more fully assessed before the vaccines can be moved from their current status of being experimental (FDA classification) to fully approved. In the UK it has been recommended that under 40s have an alternative to the AZ vaccine due to the risk of blood clots being greater than the risk associated with illness from Covid. With respect to those who are classed as non-vulnerable to illness from Covid there is a cost-benefit analysis that needs to be done to determine whether or not taking the vaccine will put increased net pressure on health services.
I agree that Covid is a much bigger strain on health services than the vaccine side effects, but non-vulnerable people are less at risk from Covid than they are from a typical cold. There are exceptions, as with your friend. Statistically speaking though the benefits of young healthy people taking the vaccine as a means of protecting themselves from Covid is going over the score. The vaccine provides a massive reduction is severe cases of Covid in the vulnerable and it is also not necessary for the population to be fully vaccinated for herd-immunity to be achieved. The percentage of people required to have antibodies to achieve herd-immunity varies by region, but I've seen estimates of 60% for the UK. This value has already been achieved between vaccination and natural developed immunity among the population, therefore negating the need for vaccinations to be extended to the non-vulnerable.
The biggest study of its kind to date has found no evidence of asymptomatic transmission ([https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695)).

1. Historical facts
Look at all the archeological findings that show the Bible is true
\-Babylon (which is mentioned in the Old Testament) was excavated between 1899 and 1917 by a German team led Robert Koldewey.  
\-The Dead Sea Scrolls which were found in 1947 by Shepherds in a cave on the Western side of the Dead Sea. These contained over 800 documents written in Hebrew along with fragments of 190 Biblical Scrolls, and a complete word for word copy of Isaiah was also found along with almost the Entire Old Testament books.
\-The Tel Dan Inscription which was discovered in 1993. This stone was found with the inscription ""*BYTDWD""* Which scholars have concluded either means ""House of David"" or refers to the lineage of David. The term ""House of David"" is actually used in Scripture
Isaiah 22:22 ""   The key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; So he shall open, and no one shall shut; And he shall shut, and no one shall open.""
\-Hezekiah's Tunnel which was the dependable water source for Jerusalem was found in 1867 by Charles Warren. This is Specifically mentioned in 2 Chronicles 32 when it says ""blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David""
Look at the Historical Proof
\-History proves Jesus existed. There are people outside of the Bible who wrote that Jesus existed. 
 Cornelius Tacitus who was a Roman Senator said:
""\[N\]either human effort nor the emperor‚Äôs generosity nor the placating of the gods ended the scandalous belief that the fire had been ordered \[by Nero\]. Therefore, to put down the rumor, Nero substituted as culprits and punished in the most unusual ways those hated for their shameful acts ‚Ä¶ whom the crowd called ‚ÄúChrestians.‚Äù The founder of this name, Christ, had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate ‚Ä¶ Suppressed for a time, the deadly superstition erupted again not only in Judea, the origin of this evil, but also in the city \[Rome\], where all things horrible and shameful from everywhere come together and become popular.""
The Bible and this says that Jesus was Crucified by Pilate. So, check that off the evidence list. 
Josephus, a Jewish priest, who was involved with three Roman Emperors said this:
""Being therefore this kind of person \[i.e., a heartless Sadducee\], Ananus, thinking that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus had died and Albinus was still on his way, called a meeting \[literally, ‚Äúsanhedrin‚Äù\] of judges and brought into it the brother of Jesus-who-is-called-Messiah ‚Ä¶ James by name, and some others. He made the accusation that they had transgressed the law, and he handed them over to be stoned""
Historical records show that James was martyred, so again, check!
He also said:
""Around this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man.21 For he was one who did surprising deeds, and a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who in the first place came to love him did not give up their affection for him, for on the third day, he appeared to them restored to life. The prophets of God had prophesied this and countless other marvelous things about him. And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, have still to this day not died out.""
Celsus, the Platonist philosopher, considered Jesus to be a magician who made exorbitant claims
Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor and friend of Tacitus, wrote about early Christian worship of Christ ‚Äúas to a god.‚Äù
None of these writings are in the Bible and most of these people were not Believers, but they knew Jesus existed. 
Also, think about this. Now that you know (but you can still deny) that Jesus truly did exist and was killed exactly as the Bible says, why can't we find one bit of DNA of him after he died? Why can't we find any evidence of his bones or sin? Either he neve existed (which I have just proven to you that he did, or he really did rise from the dead, he was who he said he was. 
Look at the common sense evidence:
If the Bible is not real and God does not exist and this is all an accident: then why is everything placed so perfectly to sustain life on Earth. If Evolution is true, then why don't we see fish turning into dogs or vice verse? Dogs and fish may change, but they are still dogs and fish, they do not evolve into other species. Why are humans considered the highest level of Evolution if other animals are faster and stronger than we are. 
A cheetah can run 50-80 MPH, a Horse can run 55 MPH, a cat and German Shepherd can run 30 MPH, while humans can only run 28 which is the highest recorded. 
The Bible says that we are made in the image of God, and that we are special to God. But the Bible also says that we are sinners and have broken the laws of God. But God loved us, so he sent Jesus to the Earth to die on the cross for our sins. Jesus died, was buried and three days later he rose from the dead and the Bible says that anyone who puts their faith and trust in him will have Eternal Life:
Romans 10:9 ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""",2022-01-22,4,COMMENT

Pfizer is going for full FDA approval now, so maybe this part won't be an issue for him soon. Hundreds of millions of people have been safely inoculated though. Getting the pandemic under control is by getting as many people vaccinated as soon as possible. Like 70% of the people.
With that being said, some people will probably judge and want to not mingle. Not much you can do about that.  It is his choice to live in a very restricted way, but how do you feel about living like that too? What if that is how he really likes to live? Are you okay with potentially being barred from doing things as a couple? You cannot control what others think, or choose to do, but can control how /if you live in it.
Perhaps you should to consider is: Is this a dealbreaker? If you truly stand by him, then do it, stand firm and see how it plays out. If you want more out of your life that vaccines provide right now you should have a real talk with him about what this means for you.
Edit to say: I am sorry this is a tough one. Best of luck you him and you. Stay safe.",2022-01-22,4,COMMENT

I'd just say ""we've thought about it a lot and made our choices"" and leave it at that. If they want to have a discussion about it, engage with them calmly and politely. If you don't want to get into it with people, I'd recommend not disclosing his unvaccinated status, but if he wants to, that is his choice. If people start being pushy, you can remind them that getting vaccinated is ultimately a personal choice, and that he is neither legally required not morally obligated to get vaccinated, and that spending time with him (or not) is their choice as well.
It sounds like he's thought about it a lot, has legitimate concerns, and his mind is made up. I wouldn't try to convince him unless you want to get into more arguments. Maybe you can leave it alone for a little while, then try again later? If it eases your anxiety a little, remember that the vaccine is extraordinarily effective, so you should be protected even if he gets it, and if you get it, you're unlikely to spread it to him. It sounds like he's being really careful, so hopefully that puts him at less risk. Also, SO many people are getting the vaccine, which will also protect him.",2022-01-22,4,COMMENT

2045,n4a9zi,I'm beginning to think....,https://www.reddit.com//r/CovidVaccine/comments/n4a9zi/im_beginning_to_think/gwv38n5/,CovidVaccine,"This. Similar to how people will leave reviews after a bad experience more than they tend to leave one after a good or neutral experience. Likely because when everything goes swimmingly, it tends to leave your mind  because that‚Äôs how it was supposed to go - nothing out of the ordinary and all that. When things go bad or not as expected, we feel gypped and make a complaint either with the hope that we‚Äôll be made whole or at least validated; or just simply to warn others. When we commiserate together, we don‚Äôt feel so alone. 
Likewise, it gives us some perspective. Some people may have anxiety and know they have a tendency to overthink, overreact, or just get stuck in their own head so hearing someone else say, ‚ÄúI hear you and I understand‚Äù or ‚Äúthis was also my experience‚Äù helps us realize we‚Äôre not crazy or alone; and sometimes we come out on the other side with some useful coping advice. 
I also think it helps people who are or may be hesitant to get the vaccine so they know what they‚Äôre getting into ahead of time. The clinical view is cut-and-dry regarding side side effects but it lacks that human factor and doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell you the severity. There‚Äôs also not really any universal guidelines on how to deal with/treat the symptoms, if at all - or if a certain treatment you‚Äôd normally use is safe in this instance. Instead they just tell you to report any side effects and that‚Äôs it. It can seem like you‚Äôre just another number, which just further validates those who already think this is some ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù. Sure, you can ask your doctor, but majority of people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated by their doctor or anyone they‚Äôre familiar with. There needs to be a human factor in my opinion. I don‚Äôt mean everyone should be coddled - I just mean they need to relay information like they‚Äôre talking to other humans rather than their fellow lab coats. There‚Äôs currently a clash of personalities between average people and scientists/doctors, and the trend is only growing. People want to feel like they at least matter. If they‚Äôre not getting that, they‚Äôre going to wonder why they should bother to help out; or why they should care about the greater good if those overseeing the greater good don‚Äôt seem to care.
The cut-and-dry/clinical outlook also doesn‚Äôt account for side effects that end up being rather common but weren‚Äôt shared initially, whether it was from lack of discovery due to inability to find a causal link, overlooked them due to other factors, or weren‚Äôt prevalent enough to be noteworthy or significant. So sharing negative experiences here allows those who are or may be hesitant to access more information - information that they‚Äôre not getting elsewhere - in order to be well-informed and decide what‚Äôs right for them. I think a lot of the reason people tend to distrust the science and those in the field is because they feel like they‚Äôre not being told the full truth or they feel like information is being directly withheld from them. Why would something need to be hidden if it was safe? (This is not my view; just my observation based on conversations I‚Äôve had with some who are skeptical.) 
Theres a big disconnect going on and until that gap is bridged, I‚Äôm afraid the gap is only going to widen. Humans need connection and compassion. If you want people to listen, that‚Äôs the recipe. Talking to them in a robotic and seemingly unsympathetic manner isn‚Äôt going to do anyone any good.",2022-01-05,17,COMMENT

For instance, I was originally in the ‚Äúno symptoms‚Äù camp because I didn‚Äôt have symptoms the day of or the following day.

The virus spreading indefinitely among unvaccinated isn't true. I realize this is a narrative being pushed, but it is contrary to:
1) everything we understand about immunology
2) human evolution and
3) everything we know about prior pandemics and epidemics.
When someone recovers from COVID, they have conferred immunity. How long this lasts we technically do not know yet, but based on that same technicality, we also don't know this for the vaccines. In reality, both the vaccines and natural immunity should prove lasting UNTIL we start to see variants with significant mutations around multiple immune epitopes. Since Sars-Cov-2 mutates at a rate close to Flu (slightly less), this will likely be around 5 years of immunity against the worst of the disease for those who recover. (This has been found to be the immune escape rate for influenza).
My point is - assuming we can reach a SIGNIFICANT portion of the population vaccinated, the UNvaccinated population will not simply get infected over and over again. Those who have recovered are immune, and the point when those individuals need to worry about immune escape is the same point as those who are vaccinated.
The key folks in the equation are those who have NEVER been exposed and are also not vaxxed - but that proportion of folks shrinks every day since every infection pulls from this pool and adds to the immune pool.
Tldr get vaccinated, but also trust our immune systems and evolution to take care of the rest.",2021-12-26,7,COMMENT

That is why making your own vaccine card using the same template is a crime...
**Title 18 United States Code, Section 1017**
"" **Whoever fraudulently or wrongfully affixes or impresses the seal of any department or agency of the United States, to or upon any certificate, instrument, commission, document, or paper or with knowledge of its fraudulent character, with wrongful or fraudulent intent, uses, buys, procures, sells, or transfers to another any such certificate, instrument, commission, document, or paper, to which or upon which said seal has been so fraudulently affixed or impressed, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.**""
Untrained eyes would not catch the lack of a CDC logo on a vaccine card. But that would technically not be breaking the law. But it would be a crappy thing to do. People aren't passing out versions of the cards that are from vaccination clinics that use their own template instead of the CDC one. they are passing out the ones with the CDC logo.
Can you specify how I am ""lying"" about forgery? 
I have no beef with you if you aren't making fake vaccine cards or are in possession of one...

Yep.  Or the exact opposite, where they think you're crazy for getting it because it's a depopulation conspiracy or whatever.  
It feels like this pandemic has made everyone insanely polarized in one direction or the other and incapable of any kind of critical thinking.  I've just been hiding from society for the most part.  I don't want to deal with it.",2021-12-31,8,COMMENT

I got my first Pfizer shot, and only after began researching this.
